[{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"Before I had even finished it, I’d bought 2 copies of this book: one for my parents, and the other for my partner’s. I admit, some chapters review much of what I already knew; exercise is very good for our brains and body (and you don’t need to be a gym rat - just get your heart rate up!); healthy eating isn’t prescribable, but it’ll include eating a range of unprocessed food (processed food is bad), eating in moderation, less sweets, and finding a diet that works best for you (without going to the extremes). But the many reviews of the latest neuroscience and how they apply to us as we age was fascinating. For example, a reason we “always have room for dessert” is the novel flavours (sweet after salty) pique your interest even though enough was several mouthfuls ago.\nI made far too many bookmarks throughout, so I’ll jump right in. Here are a collection of my favourite quotes and moments from this book:\n “The eldest child in a multi child household tends to take on some of the parenting and instruction of the younger ones; the youngest child may be relatively coddled or ignored, depending on the parents; the middle child may find herself thrust into the role of peacemaker.” -\u003e I do have the urge to arbitrate peace…\n  Personality traits were very difficult to study because culture and language play a role in shaping them. To get around this, researchers realized ‘The more important an individual difference is in human transactions, the more languages will have a term for it.’ “And so, intrepid researchers… studied the languages of diverse cultures from around the globe. Consider one type of individual difference, mental illness. It seems rather important to know whether a person you’re interacting with is sane, rational, and emotionally stable, or hears voices in their head. It turns out that people as diverse as the Inuit in Alaska; Yoruba tribes of Nigeria; and the Pintupi aborigines of Australia, have words in their languages for these important personality descriptors.\n  “To become more conscientious, one must change underlying cognitive processes such as self-regulation, and self-monitoring. If you wish you [were better at this, checkout] David Allen’s book Getting Things Done.\n  Interesting anecdote of someone with hypermnesia (the opposite of amnesia, essentially having super memory) was that they couldn’t recognize friends and colleagues because “everyone has so many faces.”\n  \" This is how memory works in the brain - as soon as you retrieve a memory, it becomes editable, just like a text document; it enters a vulnerable state and can get rewritten without your intent, consent, or knowledge. Often, a memory is rewritten by new information that gets coloured in during one recollection, and then that new information gets grafted onto and stored with the old, all seamlessly, without your conscious awareness. This process can happen over and over again until the original memory in your brain has been replaced with subsequent interpretations , impressions, and recollections.” -\u003e Shortly after reading this, I was recounting an excursion that had been so-so, but was in a terrible headspace when asked about it, and I found my retelling of the tale was done with a negative spin! Clearly, my negative mood was colouring the memory, which was a light bulb moment for me. Perhaps that is why when I ask my grandmother how her day is going she just says “don’t ask me that dear, getting old is for the birds!” When you don’t have something nice to say, best not to say (or think) anything at all.\n  I’ve come to believe that Multiple-trace theory (MTT) is the correct way of looking at memory… It provides a compelling explanation for why we forget recent events when we age but still remember older ones: The older ones created more memory traces, either through repetition or through multiple recollections of them.”\n  Strengthen your brain games haven’t been shown to work across functions outside of the games you’re playing. But there are apps for building memory, “and those are an integral part of the program of healthy brain practices, such as Neurotrack.”\n  “The young infant lives in a state of psychedelic splendour in which a green light might have a taste, or their mother’s voice might elicit a warm and smooth sensation on the skin. Some babies never completely achieve sensory differentiation and then have a condition called synesthesia. There is some evidence that adults who develop certain forms of dementia can revert to this state, and it has been suggested that this may account, in part, for why some older adults develop a new interest in art quite suddenly.”\n  “Successfully making contact with a moving target, such as a spinning mobile over the crib, or catching a ball, is so important that it has a special name, interceptive timing. This skill is a precursor to mathematical ability: It usually has to develop before a child can represent abstract concepts such as numbers.”\n  “The term critical period is used to describe a time window within which a particular skill or ability needs to be cultivated with the right environmental input, or it can never be acquired (these windows are statistically distributed). You may remember some of these famous examples if you ever took a psychology class. Kittens who were deprived of normal visual input never develop normal eyesight. Kittens that wore an eye patch never develop binocular vision or depth perception, and kittens raised in the dark never learn to see, even though their eyes are fine (Many scientists today regret that the kitten experiments were considered ethical at the time, in the 1950’s)”.\n  “Older adults who want to maintain their sense of balance and orientation must not just observe the environment but also move around… Neuroplasticity is what keeps us young, and it is only a walk in the park away.”\n  “Exercise, meditation, listening to music, immersing yourself in nature, and sometimes just talking to friends and having social support can help to reduce stress significantly.”\n  \" Withdrawal from the world after a negative experience is evolutionarily adaptive - it gives us time to heal and to reflect productively on what went wrong so that we can avoid or correct patterns of our own behaviour that can lead to trouble.\"\n  “Spend time with people who encourage you to grow, to explore new things, and who take joy in your successes. Try to find social situations that respect older adults and a role that allows you to contribute your accumulated knowledge and wisdom to a community organization whose goals you admire. And when you can, go outside. Go outside.”\n  “People who are in enriched environments - with lots of things to see, listen to, and do - experience less pain than those in simpler environments, and this sort of distraction diminishes pain signals in the insula and primary sensory cortex. Effective distractions while in pain includes exercise, hobbies, interesting conversation, practicing yoga, meditation, socializing, listening to soothing music, or immersing yourself in nature.”\n  “Melatonin levels in the blood are highest in young people (55-75 pg/ml) and start to decline after the age of forty, with the fastest decrease found from sixty years of age onward, reaching very low levels in the elderly (18-40 pg/ml). New research suggests that melatonin may have protective effects against many cancers, which may be part of the reason that as people age - and melatonin levels go down - they are more susceptible to cancers.”\n  “Among nondrug treatments [for improved aging], cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has the highest record of efficacy.”\n “Other treatments: studies that are only preliminary, and wouldn’t yet be called medicine because evidence is still being gathered:\n Vitamin B_12, found in meat, poultry, eggs, milk and fish, is necessary for the production of myelin in the brain and is involved in the metabolism of every cell in the body… We believe that [homocysteine] increases oxidative stress and increases damage to DNA and that its neurotoxicity leads to cell death. B_12 (along with B_6 and folate) is responsible for recycling homocysteine, thereby keeping its levels in check; insufficient amounts of B_12 are therefore believed responsible for a toxic buildup of homocysteine.

Well Being Score   “Daniel Pink has to say this about the middle-aged dip: ‘One possibility is the disappointment of unrealized expectations. In our naive twenties and thirties, our hopes are high, our scenarios rosy. Then reality trickled in like a slow leak in the room. Only one person gets to be CEO - and it’s not going to be you. Some marriages crumble - and yours, sadly, is one of them… Yet we don’t remain in the emotional basement for long, because over time we adjust our aspirations and later realize that life is pretty good. In short, we dip in the middle because we’re lousy forecasters. In youth, our expectations are too high.”\n  “Three questions: who’ll change my light bulbs? [i.e., who’ll do the mundane shit when you’re unable to]; What if I want an ice cream cone [i.e., are you setup to live the life you want as your systems begin to fail - do you have to drive to that ice cream, or can you walk]? and Who will I have lunch with?     “Decreasing the risk of dying from one disease has increased our risk of dying from other, arguably more horrible ones. [i.e., alzheimer’s instead of a heart attack]”     “The single most important factor in determining successful aging is the personality trait of Conscientiousness.”     “Three additional factors that determine how well we age are more important than the rest. The first is childhood experiences, in particular of parental attachment and of head injury. The second is exercise in varied, natural environments. And the third is social interaction.”     “Nearly every part of our brains is activated by interacting with others, live, face-to-face, in real time.”     “One major block to social engagement is anger…. As former US senator Alan Simpson says, ‘Hatred corrodes the container in which it is carried’.”     “Remember that the world is changing, and those changes are at odds with your accumulated experience. Force yourself to update, to keep current with changes in the world.”     “Remember also that pain is physical and informed by our senses, yet it is also influenced by emotional and cultural factors. A negative emotional state can lead to increased pain, and an otherwise painful sensation can be interpreted as positive, such as soreness after exercise.”     “Practice gratitude for what you have.”    Risk / Protective Factors   Appendix: Rejuvenating your brain:  Don’t retire.

My favourite parts were the forward, introduction, and prelude “why we must ask the big questions”, but that is because the reminder of the book reviewed ideas that I’m familiar with. It is remarkable that Stephen could write this book in his last year of life, given his limited ability to express himself (just some facial muscles by that point). That, mixed with his discussions about black holes, the beginning of the universe, and various other areas where our knowledge is incomplete were what made this book worthwhile.\n3/5.\n","description":"","tags":["Books"],"title":"Brief Answers to the Big Questions","uri":"/books/202310briefanswerstobigquestions/"},{"categories":["Good Books"],"content":"As someone with little knowledge of the American Civil War, or President Lincoln, this book was equally fascinating and well written. Lincoln’s name hasn’t gone down in history because of his superior military knowhow, or skilful “statesmanship”, but because of his superior “peculiar moral power and greatness of character”. It is truly a shame that politicians are not like Lincoln - who was so keenly aware of making the morally correct choice, at the opportune time, that he was able to craft a cabinet of rivals that balanced themselves on the whole. As is often touted today of top tier leadership, you want to foster trust, respect, and open disagreement that allows for the best ideas to flourish. Creating a leadership team of “yes-people” is never good in the long run. Lincoln was ahead of his time here, as that is exactly the atmosphere he was able to create and maintain through arguably the most trying times in all of America’s history. Comparing Lincoln (the first elected President of the Republican Party), to Donald Trump shows the alarming distance politicians have travelled into a world of short term exuberance. It is no wonder that democracy should suffer with America so divided.\nTwo of my favourite moments from this book are when Lincoln appears on the battlefield - at the distress of everyone else around him. At the start of the war, he journeys to the front line, and in the dark, takes a boat over to the enemy camp to scout out an adequate landing for his forces. This was completely unheard of, as Lincoln was no general - however, he had become fed up with the slow progress of his commander at this particular post, and took it upon himself to get the troops moving. At another battlefront, late in the war, he was within range of the enemy, to the point that the surgeon by his side was actually shot by opposing fire. Can you imagine anything so wild as the sitting president being on the front line of what was the chaos of a 19th century war?\nMoving onto a couple of my favourite quotes:\n “in times of anxiety it is critical to ‘avoid being idle,’ that ‘business and conversation of friends’ were necessary to give the mind ‘rest from that intensity of thought, which will some times wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the bitterness of death’”\n  “One of Lincoln’s favorite anecdotes spring from the early days just after the Revolution. Shortly after the peace was signed, the story began, the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen ‘had occasion to visit England’, where he was subjected to considerable teasing banter. The British would make ‘fun of the Americans and General Washington in particular and one day they got a picture of General Washington’ and displayed it prominently in the outhouse so Mr. Allen could not miss it. When he made no mention of it, they finally asked him if he had seen the Washington picture. Mr. Allen said, ‘he thought that was a very appropriated [place] for an Englishman to Keep it. Why they asked, for said Mr. Allen there is Nothing that Will Make an Englishman Shit So quick as the Sight of Genl Washington’”\n  “‘Having hope’, writes Daniel Goleman in his study of emotional intelligence, ‘means that one will not give in to overwhelming anxiety, a defeatist attitude, or depression in the face of difficult challenges or setbacks.’ Hope is ‘more than the sunny view that everything will turn out all right’; it is ‘believing you have the will and the way to accomplish your goals.’ More clearly than his colleagues, Lincoln understood that numerous setbacks were inevitable before the war could be brought to a close.”\n  “Washing was a typical American. Napoleon was a typical Frenchman, but Lincoln was a humanitarian as broad as the world. He was bigger than his country - bigger than all the Presidents together.\"\n 4/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln","tags":["Books"],"title":"Team of Rivals","uri":"/books/202309teamofrivals/"},{"categories":["Okay Books"],"content":"This book is great for anyone leading a company, and good for those wanting to know if they’re a part of an organization that is in it for the long haul. The basic premise is that companies without a proper Just Cause, and various other attributes, will at one point or another, succumb to their short sightedness, and fail. There are many examples to draw on, where companies prioritize profit over their purpose, and end up losing out to the inevitable innovation of competition.\nLeading by purpose is not easy, and it is almost never rewarded by Wall Street. Therefore, Simon argues that leaders must have courage to do the right thing, in the face of short term incentives. To find that courage, he suggests the following:\n “Find a Just Cause that inspires us; surround ourselves with others with whom we share common cause, people we trust and who trust us; identify a Rival worthy of comparison that will push us to constantly improve; and remind ourselves that we are more committed to the Cause than to any particular path or strategy we happen to be following right now.”\n This excerpt was taken from the final chapter, and is a good summary of all the preceding chapters, which do a better job of highlighting why each of these ideas is important, and examples of what to-do, and what not-to-do.\n3/5.\n","description":"","tags":["Books"],"title":"The Infinite Game","uri":"/books/202308infinitegame/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"This book was the first time I came into contact with a history of chemistry, and it was absolutely fascinating. Histories of physics have been my default, due to their ongoing contributions to the origins of life, the universe and everything; but much of that history is the back and forth of military funded experiments, and intellectual genius. Chemistry, on the other hand, was funded by the wealthy in an attempt to create more wealth through transmutation (i.e., alchemy), as well as the mishaps of mad scientists tinkering with “the elements”.\nThis book covers over two thousand years of history, which includes the origin story of many words (some are included below), and the intellectual struggle of determining what exactly is an element? The following are ideas, and excerpts from the book to hopefully give you an idea of why it was such an engaging read.\nAristotle was responsible for creating a worldview that would last almost 2 thousand years. His scientific brilliance was built on the lens of object qualities, rather than object properties. In this way, he failed to see a world composed of atoms, which had been proposed by Democritus decades before Aristotle. Instead, he saw the world through four “basic elements”: Earth ws the center, next came water, above that was air, and above the air fire.\n “All motion in the world was the attempt of the elements to find their rightful place. Thus stones fell to the bottom of water, bubbles rose up out of it, fire rose upwards through the air and so forth. But the sun, the moon and the stars clearly did not move in such a way, so Aristotle proposed a fifth element. This rarefied element he called aether. Remnants of this element persist in our words ethereal (celestial, airy), and quintessence (literally ‘fifth essence’)”\n  “[The middle ages were] not so much an anti-scientific age as an a-scientific one. There was simply no need for science in an age without progress, an age which believed that timeless spiritual values were superior to the vagaries of reality”\n Once discovered, sulphuric acid transformed the development of many materials, so much so that until the mid-twentieth century, a country’s development was measured by the volume of sulphuric acid it’s industry used each year!\nNicolas Flamel was a real person who set out on an alchemical pilgrimage through France and Spain in search of the philosopher’s stone - his published memoirs mention: “Finally, in the yeere of the restoring of mankind, 1382, I made a projection of the Red stone upon the like quantity of Mercury the five and twentieth day of April, about five a clock in the Evening; which I transmuted truly into almost as much pure Gold, better assuredly than common Gold, more soft, and more pliable.”\nTheophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim, better known as Paracelsus, was another well known character in the history of Alchemy - which I suppose was a nod from Full Metal Alchemist.\n “The Arabic name for the substance with which Jezebel painted her eyes was kohl. By a series of misapprehensions this word came to be used to describe distilled liquids, and eventually the distilled liquid al-kohl (the kohl) - which became alcohol” Many other words with the “al” prefix come from Arabic - like Algebra, Algorithm, Alkali, and even Alchemy etc.\n  “Hydrogen” comes from the Greek hydro “water” and -gen, “generator, getter, maker”\n 5/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"The quest for the elements","tags":["Books"],"title":"Mendeleyev’s dream","uri":"/books/202308mendeleyevsdream/"},{"categories":["Worst Books"],"content":"This book has maybe two interesting parts to it.

If you have diarrhea - you’re losing a lot of water, drink more. If your poop experience is poor, try…  eating more fiber, but ramp up slowly as you might not have the right mix of microbes at the start. boosting the diversity of your microbiome by eating plain yogurt (daily), and fermented foods like kimchi or kombucha.   When you travel, expect to have a bad time - best to prepare your microbiome beforehand with the above tips.  Some other notes I took: Useful  Overuse of laxatives in general can decrease absorption of nutrients and other medications, cause electrolyte imbalances, create dependency and actually worsen constipation by interfering with the colon’s natural contractions. Yellow and greasy suggest not digesting fat well; and that evaluation for celiac disease or another cause of malabsorption is warranted. Green stool could be food passing too quickly and not giving your bile a chance to break down into brown colour; Black could be bleeding in upper tract or black licorice Red could be beets or bleeding in lower tract - often hemorrhoids but sometimes more seriously colon cancer White or clay-coloured / devoid of colour from bile suggests a blockage in a duct that carries bile from liver to gallbladder -\u003e in infants is life threatening if not corrected Constipation can tear the main intestinal lining and cause anal fissures. Intense pressure on the colon can cause diverticulitis (inflamed or infected pouches of gut tissue), hemorrhoids (akin to varicose veins; also can be from prolonged sitting on the pot), to more serious conditions like defecation syncope (fainting on the toilet), or even a stroke. Posture modification on the toilet can reduce strain and encourage a more complete evacuation. When ramping up on fiber, if you didn’t already eat a lot of fiber, you’ll need to ramp up slowly, to avoid stomach cramps (as it’s unlikely you have the right fiber-munching bacteria to begin with). Slow and steady can cultivate the microbiome you seek, and adding fermented foods / yogurt can do wonders too. The bacteria sometimes take time to ramp up the right metabolic pathways or fiber-processing genes. In artificial guts, you see bacteria don’t degrade the fiber as much on the first day compared to the next. Microbiome disruptions like: food poisoning, international travel, and dietary changes are all associated with shifts in gut flora. Sometimes, these changes can introduce totally new species that sometimes wipe out weaker competition. However, it is usually the case that the system as a whole preserves their functionality - like digesting carbohydrates. This is where food sensitivity tests, and microbiome lab tests (stool testing) fall short. It’s an expensive snapshot of your current system that will need to be done again in the near future. Eating a diet rich in fermented foods like: yogurt, kimchi, and kombucha tea for many weeks shows signs of improved gut microbiome diversity and reduced signs of inflammation compared to counterparts on a high-fiber diet. “The bacteria food alone isn’t enough; we need the bacteria that can eat it.” Caution: nothing is guaranteed. What works for others won’t necessarily work for you  Less useful, but noteworthy  Constipation - colon absorbs too much water. 15 major classes of drugs can cause constipation, according to one tally, even tylenol can stop things up Many drugs cause diarrhea by increasing intestinal muscle movements that push everything onwards. Allergies, infections, contaminated or overly spicy food can trigger an immune response to flush out the system. Can be from IBS, lactose intolerance, diseases, drugs or damage can inflame or tear the intestinal lining, interfering with water absorption that makes matters worse. Some researchers claim timing transit is more important than Bristol stool scale. Median is 29 hours. Range is 4 hours - 10 days Longer transit time associated with greater gut diversity -\u003e not sure how well studied this is And greater diversity isn’t always a good thing -\u003e if that diversity includes an unfavourable mix. C-section + instant formula over vagina birth + breastfeeding alter microbiome in ways that increase the risk of asthma and allergies. Babies exposed to a broader diversity of microbes are more protected and have lower risk of bad lifelong health outcomes Think of your microbiome as your mini ecosystem for which you are the caretaker. * If you eat poorly, don’t prioritise sleep, exercise, and a balanced lifestyle, your microbiome is likely to get out of balance.  Not useful, but cool  German made: Flachspuler - or flat-flush toilet, helps people examine their stool before being flushed People in the US eat about 30-35% of the fiber that they should - which makes the average deposit in western toilets a fraction of what they should be Lots of applications for measuring specific biomarkers like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and smaller metabolites that your microbes create. These have been used to predict childhood obesity and even intelligence. However, this research is beyond the scope of Gut Hub - and the research is very new. It’s unclear in which direction the relationship is causal; does measurable intelligence modify your gut biome, or the other way around?  3/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"The remarkable science of an unlikely treasure","tags":["Books"],"title":"Flush","uri":"/books/202212flush/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"A masterpiece in fun-reading education; this book is accessible to everyone who’s goal is to learn statistics. And for those with a strong handle on the subject, it is a good reminder of the pitfalls of being too brash with the toolkit.\nMy key takeaways:\nAlways check both mean and median Using one without knowing the other can be dangerous, as both are good at hiding data. Mean can easily hide the distribution, while median hides outliers. Better yet, use both AND include a distribution graph.\nCommon biases:  Selection bias: poorly sampled data skewing results Publication bias: omitting negative results via preference for positive news Recall bias: our memories suck - or at least they are different than lived experience Survivorship bias: what hedge funds do healthy user bias: does pills make you healthier or do healthy ppl take pills?  Central limit theorem (CLT) The mean of sampled populations will create its own normal distribution, regardless if the population being sampled is normally distributed. The mean of this normal distribution will overlap with the true mean of the population.\nThe Standard Error (SE) of the sampled means will be proportional to the standard deviation of the underlying population, and the sample number (N).\nReview chapter 9 for an elegant example using CLT to infer brain size difference between kids with / without autism. Reviews p-values, SE between 2 means, and one vs two tail hypothesis testing.\nPolling Polling is an interesting application of statistics in that we can sample a small subset of the entire population, and if done correctly, have a pretty good understanding of the outcome. That is, one must be careful not to accidently introduce a selection bias, and the way in which questions are asked can make a big difference as well.\nAn aside: SE of polling uses a different formula, which has a maximum variance when the results are 50 / 50.\nRegression analysis The regression coefficient is simply the slope of the line; the residual is the “error” or deviation away from the straight line slope for every dependent variable; independent variables are often called “explanatory”, or “control” variables.\nThe R^2 measures the total amount of variation explained by the regression equation.\nMultiple regression analysis is simply a multi-dimensional slope that allows a comparison between explanatory variables to determine how much each variable contributes to the dependent variable.\nCommon regression mistakes  Using regression for a non-linear relationship Correlation does not equal causation Reverse causality (B actually causes A, rather than A -\u003e B) Omitted variable bias (i.e., missing age when it is in fact the strongest predictor) Highly correlated explanatory variables (multicollinearity) Extrapolating beyond the data Data mining (too many variables)  Gotchas:  Assuming events are independent when they’re not: i.e., plane engine failures.

The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided.”\n  “It sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough for investing gains to work in your favor.”\n  “What do you expect people to do when momentum creates a big short-term return potential?

The magnitude of breakthroughs in theoretical physics between the late 1800’s and early 1900’s is staggering. Kumar takes you through those breakthroughs one at a time, carefully including personal anecdotes of the great scientists as their leaps of understanding changed the world.\nHere is a collection of my favourite moments:\nThe birth of quantum (1900):  “Applying Boltzmann’s techniques, Planck discovered that he could derive his formula for the distribution of blackbody radiation only if the oscillators absorbed and emitted packets of energy that were proportional to their frequency of oscillation.” “The problem for Planck was that Boltzmann’s procedure for slicing energy required that at the end the slices be made ever thinner until mathematically their thickness was zero and they vanished, with the whole being restored. To reunite a slice-up quantity in such a fashion was a mathematical technique at the very heart of calculus. Unfortunately forPlanck, if he did the same his formula vanished too. He was stuck with quanta, but was unconcerned. He had his formula; the rest could be sorted out later.”\n Ref:\n https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/11725/how-to-get-to-planck-s-radiation-law-as-planck-did-it-warts-and-all http://strangepaths.com/files/planck1901.pdf http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Planck%20(1900),%20Distribution%20Law.pdf  The birth of photons (1905): The photoelectric effect was a measure of the energy of electrons emitted when light was shown at them. “It was expected that increasing the intensity of a light beam, by making it brighter, would yield the same number of electrons, but with each having more energy. However, the opposite was found: a greater number of electrons were emitted with no change in their individual energy.”\n “Whereas Planck had only quantised the emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation so that his imaginary oscillators would produce the correct spectral distribution of blackbody radiation, Einstein had quantised light itself. The energy of a quantum of yellow light was just Planck’s constant multiplied by the frequency of yellow light.”\n Evidence for atoms (1905): “Einstein realised that Brownian motion was due to water molecules regularly deviating from their ‘normal’ behaviour as some of them got bunched up and struck the pollen together, sending it in a particular direction.\nUsing this insight, Einstein succeeded in calculating the average horizontal distance a particle would travel as it zigzagged along in a given time. He predicted that in water at 17 degrees C, suspended particles with a diameter of one-thousandth of a millimetre would move on average just six-thousandths of a millimetre in one minute. Einstein had come up with a formula that offered the possibility of working out the size of atoms.”\n3 years later, in 1908, his predictions were confirmed, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1926.\nMore timelines: 1911: Rutherford announces the discovery of the atomic nucleus at a meeting in Manchester, England.\n1913: Bohr hears about Balmer’s formula for the spectral lines of hydrogen for the first time (Feb). He presents his new theory of the quantum atom at the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Sept).\n1914: The Franck-Hertz experiment confirms Bohr’s concept of quantum jumps and atomic energy levels.\n1916: Sommerfeld proposes a theory for the fine structure of hydrogen, and introduces a second quantum number to replace Bohr’s circular orbits with ellipticals. Einstein discovers the phenomena of spontaneous and induced emission of a photon from an atom. Sommefeld adds the magnetic quantum number to Bohr’s original atomic model.\n1919: Experimental evidence for general relativity is found (light deflected by gravitational fields). Einstein becomes a global celebrity overnight.\n1923: Scattering of X-ray photons by atomic electrons is found (the ‘Compton effect’), bringing irrefutable evidence in support of photons. De Broglie links waves with electrons extending wave-particle duality to incorporate matter.\n1925: Pauli discoveres the exclusion principle. Heisenberg develops the beginning of matrix mechanics, the first theory of quantum. Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck propose the concept of quantum spin. Pauli applies matrix mechanics to the hydrogen atom.\n1926: Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan publish their paper on matrix mechanics. Schrodinger’s first paper on wave mechanics is published. Shrodinger and others prove that wave mechanics and matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent. They are two forms of the same theory - quantum mechanics.\n1927: Evidence for wave-particle duality applied to matter is found via diffracting electrons. Heisenberg discovered the uncertainty principle. Bohr presents his principle of complementarity and the central elements of what would become known as the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.\nQuantum Mechanics:  “The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum atom could account for the frequency of hydrogen’s spectral lines, but not how bright or dim they were. Heisenberg’s idea was to separate what was observable and what was not. The orbit of an electron around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom was not observable. So Heisenberg decided to abandon the idea of electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom.\n  “Neils Bohr would soon argue that until an observation or measurement is made, a microphysical object like an electron does not exist anywhere. Between one measurement and the next it has no existence outside the abstract possibilities of the wave function. It is only when an observation or measurement is made that the ‘wave function collapses’ as one of the ‘possible’ states of the electron becomes the ‘actual’ state of the probability of all the other possibilities become zero.”\n  “Bell was able to calculate the limits on the degree of spin correlation between pairs of entangled electrons in a Bohm-modified EPR experiment. He found that in the ethereal realm of quantum there is a greater level of correlation if QM reigns supreme than in any world that depends on hidden variables and locality. Bell’s theorem said that no local hidden variables theory could reproduce the same set of correlations as QM. Any local hidden variable theory would lead to spin correlations that generated numbers called the correlation coefficient between -2 and +2. However, for certain orientations of the spin detectors, QM predicted correlation coefficients that lay outside the range known as ‘Bell’s inequality’ that ran from -2 to +2. (1964).\n  “The testing of Bell’s inequality directly or indirectly helped spawn new areas of research including quantum cryptography, quantum information theory, and quantum computing. Among the most remarkable of these new fields is quantum teleportation.”\n The electron microscope (1931): “No particle smaller than approximately half the wavelength of white light can absorb or reflect light waves so as to make the particle visible through an ordinary microscope. However, with wavelengths more than 100,000 times smaller than that of light, electron waves could. The construction of the first commercial electron microscope began in England in 1935.”\n4/5.\n","description":"","tags":["Books"],"title":"Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality","uri":"/books/202209quantumgreatdebate/"},{"categories":["Good Books"],"content":"For those unfamiliar with how impactful luck is in our lives, this book is an eye opener.

But that doesn’t stop us from indulging once in a while, or feeling sorry for folks with unhealthy food addictions. That a burger can cost more than a broccoli head is a problem. But that isn’t the problem I want to talk about here. The infinite information feed, endlessly scrollable, sometimes sweet, definitely salty, condensed news. Delivered daily, 24/7, piping hot.\nIf we viewed fast information as we do fast food, I think we’d have a much clearer time talking to each other. Let’s start with what I mean by fast information. Or a “fast feed”, as I’ll call it.\nAs the name suggests, it is information delivered quickly - without time to discuss the many viewpoints on a topic, their merits and their issues. It’s information delivered without empathy or appreciation for the complexities of the subject. The trade offs. Rather, fast information gives you a header, the abstract, and a conclusion. Who has time for the main body of work, let alone the history and references? Just tell me why I should care, and who is to blame for our slow progress.\nWhen a majority of our news is consumed like this, as a fast feed, our society’s ability to have meaningful conversations breaks down. It’s analogous to our healthcare system when a majority of our food is consumed as fast food. Our ability to lead healthy lives breaks down.\nThe social rupture occurs in 2 ways: i) we are less tolerant of alternative viewpoints - how could anyone be against our fast feed diet, which is so clear? The “other’s” point of view is beyond hopeless, and not worth engaging with. Said another way, we are less empathetic. ii) We consider ourselves well educated on the topic, knowing enough to articulate what we think, and why we think it. Yet we do not believe there is nuance, or a middle ground worth working towards. Instead, our fast feed reinforces our beliefs, till suddenly, we feel a sense of understanding that is more trustworthy than the institutional experts we think might be corrupt.\nThis problem is increasingly affecting everyone, regardless of your background, community, and beliefs. The most obvious example is the political divide in America, but there are more casualties than the democracy of the free world. Friendships lost during the pandemic, as opposing ideas cast disbelief in people we thought we knew. Lives have been ruined by delayed or misplaced aid. And all of this creates a negative feedback loop of anger, and a desire to escape to one’s fast-feed fix. Which’ll helpfully point fingers while gracefully tip-toeing around the idea that itself is to blame.\nA lot of what I’m saying might resonate with you, but does it hold any water? I recently finished reading Stolen Focus by Johann Hari, where this idea is dug into. Turns out, there is research that the more fiction novels you read, the better you are (on average) at reading other people’s emotions (but not for nonfiction). This improvement in our ability to empathize was also found in children who consumed more long-format TV series, or movies. But not shorter shows. I’m sure the research is weak, and more work needs to be done before anything is conclusive, but it’s a start. To me, the idea that a fast feed information diet is hurting our ability to communicate and find a middle ground is powerful. It’s easy to understand, and provides a framework moving forward. Less news from a fast feed will improve your communication. If you want to learn about the world, there are no shortcuts. I’m not saying you shouldn’t consume any information this way. Indulging once in a while is fun. But don’t trick yourself into thinking a fast feed is a nutritious information diet.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Our fast info-feed diet","uri":"/posts/fast_feed/"},{"categories":["Okay Books"],"content":"This book introduces the reader to relativity, symmetry and space-time through Feynman’s eyes. He discusses features of our universe with engaging analogies, like how to distinguish right from left (which is a tricky business). Or why we have time dilation from gravity. However, I’d argue that there are better books introducing audiences to these topics nowadays, like black holes and time warps by Kip S. Thorne.\nSymmetry and conservation laws “For each of the rules of symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law”, in quantum mechanics. For example, that laws are symmetrical for…\n translation in space = momentum is conserved translation in time = energy is conserved invariance under rotation = angular momentum is conserved phase shift of the wave function = electrical charge is conserved  And some are bizarre, like reflection symmetry which leads to the conservation of parity (no classical analog). However, this conservation is not conserved in matter alone. There are ways in which reflection symmetry is broken, like beta (or weak) decay. It is only with the introduction of anti-matter that the reflection symmetry is restored - and so, we say that parity is conserved under reflection and matter/antimatter symmetry. That is, “matter to the right is symmetrical with anti-matter to the left”.\nBookmarked ideas  If we have a particle of rest mass zero, it cannot stop. It always goes the speed c, as in the case of light. Photons have energy, without mass, by perpetually going the speed of light. [This is similar to how any object with rest mass non-zero cannot go the speed of light, without having an infinite amount of energy. Light has finite energy, with zero mass, yet always travels at the speed of light.] One way to think of gravitational time dilation is to picture an accelerating rocket ship with a clock at the front, and back. The clock at the front will appear to run faster than the clock at the tail due to the doppler shift of light travelling between the two clocks. And since an accelerating spaceship is the same thing as earth’s gravity (equivalence principle), we can say that blocks separated by some height H will run at different speeds! The further one runs faster than the one closer to the gravitational source. Hence, gravitational time dilation. Light gains energy as it falls towards earth, and loses some as it leaves. This is true due to the conservation of energy!  3/5.\n","description":"","tags":["Books"],"title":"Six Not-So-Easy Pieces","uri":"/books/202207sixnoteasypieces/"},{"categories":["Poor Books"],"content":"A short story about what our digital future might hold.

Problem was, I had very little time, and no money to invest, so the idea of buying Bitcoin remained on the todo list for an older me. In 2017, I revisited the idea, this time with a bit of money, but as I started to look into how to actually make a purchase, the market suddenly caught fire, and I felt I’d missed whatever opportunity had been present. Once again, buying crypto was put in the backseat for another day.\nFast forward to 2022, and I’ve finally figured out how to purchase crypto currencies, but I’m now convinced their value is 100% sentimental. Largely thanks to the financial education Rational Reminder has provided, it is clear that blockchains are a terrible form of currency. As I’ve learnt more about the technology, I still think it’s cool, but it isn’t all that innovative. The main innovation was how the software promised to revolutionize our financial system - which now feels like a debunked idea. It’s too slow at processing transactions, has no (reasonable) method of disputing fraud or mistakes of any kind, is rife with illegal activity (i.e., lots of fraud, money laundering, and ransoms), terrible for the environment, and isn’t actually cheaper than alternatives (i.e., PayPal) [1-3]. Not to mention the insane volatility in your purchasing power!\nAdding insult to injury, crypto currencies are not actually decentralized. There is a small handful of miners with 51% stake majorities in every major algorithm, and most people purchasing crypto or NFT’s do so via centralized platforms that do not always complete your purchase “on-chain”, and often lend out holdings creating complicated financial structures that look somewhat circular and dangerously close to ponzi schemes. Therefore, it comes as no surprise when exchanges are forced into bankruptcy, at the cost of their patrons [4]. Crypto bubbles like this are similar to the 2008 financial crisis, except the US gov isn’t bailing anyone out.\nIf using exchanges scares you (which it should), then you’re stuck with 2 options to complete a crypto currency transaction: i) barter with another person, and trust the blockchain transaction will post after the money has swapped hands (either in person with cash, or via global payment systems - like PayPal), or ii) trust an online peer-to-peer intermediary (who’s charging 1-2% on the trade) along with the anonymous peer you’ve been chatting with over some webforum, or exchange marketplace. None of this is regulated, and it is very time consuming. Not to mention inconvenient, and a costly way to move money around. Not just for the environment, but your wallet too.\nOh, and unless you use a central platform, you’ll have to submit the transaction authorization to the ledger yourself. Without going into any details, let’s just say this isn’t something you can do over your phone.\nSure, in a world where your company is paying you in Bitcoin, it’s not too bad. Most people are fine with the banks charging us a 2.5% markup when we move CAD to USD (although there are ways around this [5]). But the truth is, crypto currencies do not purchase any goods you actually need to live. Housing, food, utilities, etc. Sure, it provides you with some entertainment. But it’s the same entertainment you could have at an online casino.\nOne more thing. People don’t realize the power these central platforms have. Take for instance non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They’ve gained notoriety as a method for displaying ownership of digital art. Pretty neat idea, a permanent record on the internet of digital art ownership forever. So how does it work? I’ll let Moxie Marlinspike explain [6]:\n “NFTs generally do not store [images] on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.\n  Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some virtual private server running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the ‘correct’ image.”\n Not so great if your art’s URL is outside of some central crypto platform. You’d have no certainty that the art would last. But, how much certainty do you have when uploading to a platform instead? Let’s look at the dominant marketplace for NFT’s, OpenSea. Last I checked, OpenSea does something like 90+% of all NFT transactions [7], making them your most likely choice to get started. So suppose you upload some digital art to OpenSea, to sell as an NFT. Is it possible for them to alter it, or take it down? Turns out, the answer is yes! Moxie was experimenting with this exact question, and had his art delisted from their marketplace, without reason, and without having broken their terms of service [6]. He then continues to explain:\n “What I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device. This is web3, though, how is that possible?\"\n Skipping over the interesting details (worth a full read at ref. 6), the short answer is because OpenSea is so dominant, digital wallets just request to view NFT’s through their API. Moxie again:\n “if your NFT is removed from OpenSea, it also disappears from your [digital] wallet. It doesn’t functionally matter that my NFT is indelibly on the blockchain somewhere, because the wallet (and increasingly everything else in the ecosystem) is just using the OpenSea API to display NFTs, which began returning 304 No Content for the query of NFTs owned by my address!” [6]\n So in short, having your NFT removed from OpenSea is essentially the same thing as having it removed from the blockchain. So much for decentralization. But yay for VC backed central platforms?\nAnd if you want to do all the work yourself, purchasing NFTs without an exchange, good luck to you. Not only do you need to be highly proficient in computer science, but you’ll need to be good at interpreting law now too. And if you make a mistake in the code? You could lose everything, with absolutely zero recourse.\nSo, most likely, you’ll trust the central exchange to do the coding for you instead. After all, they’ve had their code audited! It couldn’t possibly have bugs in it. Well, you’d be surprised to find that indeed, these platforms do make errors, and indeed it does lead to theft. Even after audits [8] (FYI reference 8 demonstrates some of the code you’ll be working with in this brave new world).\nThis isn’t to say there isn’t value here. Crypto currencies and NFT’s have a massive influence on people, and that influence can keep the value moving up. Beyond influence, crypto provides people a convenient way to feel like they’re going to become rich. After all, they’ve seen it happen to other people, and the technology is supposed to be the internet 2.0! Or was that 3.0? The banks are corrupt, and we need DeFi tools to build the future! Just don’t think too hard about how these algorithms are not made to be viewable from your web-browser, or viewed on your smartphone (which is to say nothing about writing to the blockchain from those locations). So what if you need to spin up your own server to participate without a VC backed central platform? It can’t be that hard, can it? (rhetorical question, for those actually wondering, the answer is a resounding yes [6]).\nAt last, you almost give up. But quickly remember that private blockchains will prevail if nothing else! They’ll be more efficient, and save companies and customers money. Blockchain technology has been saved. I even heard about how Walmart is using it, and they’re basically a tech company, right? Well, all a private blockchains is, is an immutable write only data storage ledger, which has been around since the 60’s [2]. That’s right, the 60s. The only real innovation here is creating a new way for software and PR departments to spend more time together.\nSo next time you hear about how NFT’s are going to the moon [9], or how each bitcoin could one day be worth $10 million [10], remember that the only thing keeping these dreams alive are the hype themselves.\nReferences:  https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/crypto5 https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/crypto6 https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/crypto7 https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=celsius-customers-send-letters-to-the-judge-in-the-bankruptcy-case https://wealthsavvy.ca/norberts-gambit-questrade/ https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html https://etherscan.io/nfttracker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMANc7K4lHk https://future.com/podcasts/nfts-explainer/ https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-price-history-and-events-timeline  ","description":"","subtitle":"How much is good to have?","tags":null,"title":"The value of Cryptocurrencies","uri":"/posts/cryptocurrencies/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"Spirituality has a bit of a bad rap in my opinion. For starters, it’s often associated with astrology, magical connections, and various forms of fortune telling. As if your life’s path can be understood in a grand cosmic sense, if only you’d let Professor Trelawney read your tea leaves.\nThis version of spirituality has meaning for many people, and in that way, it is useful. That we reliably measure placebo and nocebo effects is proof that our mind and body are connected in ways we don’t yet fully understand. And with growing evidence for the role of the mind in disease and healing [1], I hope we oneday will. The mind-body connection is also why spiritual journeys are so powerful. A deeper feeling of peace, sometimes referred to as “oneness”, can tame your inner anxieties about life and provide clarity to a world that constantly feels in disarray.\nIt is here that I find spirituality rubs up against something real. Something we can talk about in plain language, without hand wavy predictions about your future as a pisces. Namely, spirituality defined as: a feeling of being one with the universe. Nothing more, nothing less.\nBefore discussing what a feeling of oneness with the universe means, let’s talk about why it matters. For starters, a feeling of oneness is a neutral to semi-positive state of mind. Similar to other forms of spirituality (which I would caution against), there is no negativity. There is growing support for the importance of positive emotions in later life [2], which I’d suggest is benefitted by spirituality. Another reason for wanting to feel at one with the universe is that you will have more compassion. Compassion for people you don’t know, compassion for things you’ve seen, done, or might never experience at all. Compassion for yourself. This caring will make you into a more pleasant person for yourself, others, and the planet. In my opinion, those are all good things, worth spending a little more time on. So let’s dive into what this feeling of oneness is - at a practical level.\nI find it helpful to approach this topic from three, maybe three and a half directions: relational-dependencies (i.e., ying \u0026 yang), the big bang, and mindfulness / meditation / psychedelics. I’ll let you decide if that last bucket is really two (or three?).\nTry to imagine a universe with nothing in it. A vacuum. Empty space. Boundlessly nothing in all directions. This would still have the strangeness of our universe. Quantum foam, as it’s sometimes called, with virtual particles popping in and out of existence. But without any forms of energy to play together, we’d conclude this universe is dead. Now let’s add a single proton, a hydrogen atom. A little better, but on its own, nothing can happen. It is only when we add many, many more atoms, much more energy, that we start to have the dance of our universe unfold. Gravity’s influence takes a seat beside quantum mechanics, and suddenly, fast forward some few billion years, we might stumble upon life.\nBut notice that how we arrived here was predicated on relationships. Nothing is interesting (or indeed, useful) on its own. And this can be applied to everything we experience. You would not be you without your parents, and you’d surely be a different person if you’d grown up surrounded by completely different friends. Perhaps had they been kinder, or meaner, that would have changed your snap-judgment towards strangers. And your ability to trust. Not only you, but everything, absolutely everything, is defined, understood, and meaningful, because of the way in which it interacts with other things. On our own, we are nothing. But in the balance of others, we experience meaning. It is our death that makes life worth living. You are happy because you can be sad. Ying and yang.\nAnd the big bang? Why does that matter? It matters because too often, we forget we’re all children of that single cosmic event. Similar to how a shattering glass explodes its contents outward from some central mistake, we find ourselves flung away from our big bang. The shards of glass in all shapes and sizes, some a great distance from the initial accident, are scattered across your floor. And as you sweep up the mess you’ve made, you find a very peculiar piece of glass where you didn’t think it was possible to be. We are that peculiar piece - with the most bizarre combinations of stardust. We are all descendants of a big bang who’s explosive energy created massive stars, which created bigger and heavier elements, and eventually, created all of us.\nSo we remember we are all born of the same singular cosmic parent, with a life that is codependent on everything else. In this way, we are all one. But our society has grown by selecting favourites. Preferred animals to domesticate, crops to grow, and people to rule. Humanity has shown nature that it can build better, using a different set of principles. Rather than dance to the tune of natural selection, humans can create their own music, and innovate their way out of the solar system. Truth be told, I’d love for nothing more. I’m pro space exploration - hopefully that isn’t too polarising of an opinion to say out loud. But I also recognize that in changing the song, we’re wrecking havoc. We are not just hurting the planet. Or condemning countless lives who are born into unimaginable poverty; the forgotten. Without spirituality, we have less compassion and a greater appetite for hate, which leads to self inflicted mental harm. (And worse physical health too [2]). This is where mindfulness, meditation, and psychedelics come in. These tools can help break down the social constructs in our minds. By doing so, they help us experience a more balanced life. It becomes much clearer just how connected we all are. That we are all one with the universe. Born of the same beginnings, we are dependent on each other for happiness in the present, and success in the future.\nA feeling of oneness with the universe is meaningful. Death is less scary. Compassion is easier to come by. You might find yourself helping our little planet a little more. It is for these reasons that I believe spirituality is worth considering. In the words of Alan Watts: “you are not born into this world. You are born out of it.”\nReferences:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456909/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3173764/  ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"On Being Spiritual","uri":"/posts/being_spiritual/"},{"categories":["Worst Books"],"content":"I only skimmed this book, read about 1/3 of the content, but felt I got the gist.

On the flip side, for anyone who’s not come across these ideas before (i.e., do we have free will, what do humans value, the “story” that is currency, the internet of things, etc.), I’d suggest giving this book a read. For others, I’d recommend passing.\nSome of my highlighted points include:  “Some 2,300 years ago, Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy.” The paradox of historical knowledge is that if the information does not change behaviour, it is useless; but if it does change behaviour, it is quickly irrelevant. Lawns were invented to display wealth as they are meaningless wastes of land that require many resources to remain pretty (thanks France!). “Anyone who has ever dealt with the tax authorities, the educational system or any complex bureaucracy knows that the truth hardly matters. What’s written on your form is far more important.” “Religion is a deal, whereas spirituality is a journey.” And a dangerous one at that for religious, political, and business leaders trying to keep their human resources in order. Ending a painful experience with minor pain, or even pleasure distorts our remembered history of the event. Children’s dentists know this well. Today, having power means knowing what to ignore.  Our future is increasingly one of “techo-humanism” whereby technology allows us to mediate our human desires, emotions and feelings. Humanism holds “free will” as the most important thing in the world, which complicates this newfound power. To rescue our dilemma of how to wield such power, we are moving away from a worldview that sanctifies desires/experiences, towards a new religion of “Dataism” - the worship of the creation, distribution, and utilization of data, to make the world a better place.\nThrough the lense of Dataism, democracy beat communism by being a distributed processing system, instead of centralized. As the 21’st century unfolds, the best systems for governing humans will be the one that best uses the immense amount of data our society can produce.\n3/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"A Brief History of Tomorrow","tags":["Books"],"title":"Homo Deus","uri":"/books/202206homodeus/"},{"categories":["Okay Books"],"content":"Going through a recession will never be quite the same again after reading this diary.

Conversely, when vapour from the air joins a liquid, there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface, resulting in energy added. Therefore, evaporation is the loss of heat, and consensation is the the generation of some back. When these are net equal, there is no heat exchange. However, this is a nifty thing to know when cooling hot liquids. i.e., blow on hot soup. Carbon attracts oxygen (C-O) much more than O-O or C-C. So much so, that when they come together, they snap together with such force that excess energy is distributed to their surroundings. This of course is burning, and the sensation of heat. In certain circumstances, the excess energy is given off more than molecular motion of hot gas. The energy is so great, that it generates light. This is how one gets flames! “What keeps electrons from simply falling in[to the nucleus]? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum (and therefore energy). With this energy, they’d break away from the nucleus. They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule.  Cavendish’s experiment (aka, the weighing of the earth) “If there is a force between any pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force between our own objects… It was first measured by Cavendish… demonstrating the direct force between two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, once can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately determine the coefficient G in our gravitational force equation. By knowing G from this experiement, and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we indirectly learned the mass of the earth!”\nIt was experiments like this that, and the simplicity of the mathematics that garnered peoples interest in science.\n3/5.\n","description":"","tags":["Books"],"title":"Six Easy Pieces","uri":"/books/202205sixezpieces/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"An insightful perspective on our society today, the author weaves stories of addiction throughout to illustrate how we’re easily prone to it, and how we might pull ourselves out.\nThe most insightful lesson (for me) was that pain is in fact a pleasurable time-sink, due to the pleasure-pain balance our bodies strive for. Post pain, we are often flooded with euphoric hormones to compensate. Beware of becoming addicted to pain, but, when used correctly, it is a low risk powerful stimulant.\nExamples can include: cold water sessions (I’d argue hot ones too), physical activity, caloric restriction (careful for adverse health effects), and learning something new. Ideally, we could do one thing everyday that was “painful” to help keep our pleasure-pain scale in balance.\n“Just as pain is the price we play for pleasure, so too is pleasure our reward for pain”.\nI’ll add that in our high-speed dopamine-saturated society, slow activities like yoga, meditation, and aimless mind wandering can feel painful if you’re addicted to delivering results (which itself is an addiction to pain mechanism). Over time, leaning into these activities will deliver healthier pleasure too.\nEverything in moderation.\nOther quotes:  “In humans, high levels of physical activity in junior high, high school, and early adulthood predict lower levels of drug use. Exercise has also been shown to help those already addicted to stop or cut back.” “Pain to treat pain. Anxiety to treat anxiety. This approach is counterintuitive, and exactly opposite to what we’ve been taught over the last 150 years about how to manage disease, distress, and discomfort.  Conclusion:  The relentless pursuit of pleasure (and avoidance of pain) leads to pain. Recovery begins with abstinence. Abstinence resets the brain’s reward pathway and with it our capacity to take joy in simpler pleasures. Self-binding creates literal and metacognitive space between desire and consumption, a modern necessity in our dopamine-overloaded world. Medications can restore homeostasis, but consider what we lose by medicating away our pain. Pressing on the pain side resets our balance to the side of pleasure. Beware of getting addicted to pain. Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhances intimacy, and fosters a plenty mindset. “Prosocial shame” (i.e., feeling shame for transgressive behaviours where appropriate) affirms that we belong to the human tribe. [Not to be confused with destructive shame, which is swept under the rug, and often a negative feedback loop unto itself.] Instead of running away from the world, we can find escape by immersing ourselves in it.  5/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence","tags":["Books"],"title":"Dopamine Nation","uri":"/books/202204dopaminenation/"},{"categories":["Good Books"],"content":"A must read for those itching to learn why they have a love hate relationship with technology. All ideas are presented alongside their empirical findings, including where the scientific community has a consensus, and where it does not.\nMany of these ideas are present in other self help books, like: sleep more, eat well, work less, and make time for slowness (yoga, meditation, nature walks without audio) and play. But the studies and storytelling in this book make it worthwhile nonetheless for those who are already familiar with this list.\n“Life begins at the edge of your comfort zone”.\nOn relating to others: “It’s worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives, just like you.”\nI found this idea particularly interesting. How there is research that the more fiction novels you read, the better you are (on average) at reading other people’s emotions (but not for nonfiction). This improvement in our ability to empathize was also found in children who consumed more long-format TV series, or movies. But not shorter shows.\nThis helps explain why our societies are becoming ever more divided. Our media is continuing to become compressed, from TV series, to YouTube, down to Tik Tok. It’s no wonder people have less empathy for each other than ever before.\nTechnology has overrun us: It used to be that technology was created to be an extension of us. That is what a paintbrush is, or a musical instrument.

Keeping us engaged with content that we don’t realize is influencing us. Making us less empathetic (see section above). Causing us to move faster. Multitask more.

But if you only break away from distraction into rest - if you don’t replace it with a positive goal, you are striving toward - you will always be pulled back to distraction sooner or later. The more powerful path out of distraction is to find your flow. “When people are kept awake, one of the first things to go is their ability to focus.” “Mind wandering is a different form of attention - and a necessary one.”  “In situations of low stress and safety, mind-wandering will be a gift, a pleasure, a creative force.

Allowing for new thoughts to form, connecting dots, and listening to others while creating a space that allows others to speak up.\nThis is a behaviour strength, which I’ve slowly come to learn about the more teamwork I’ve done. A personality test could have helped me uncover it too, but in general, it’s always good to be doing some “exploring”.\nThen, when you’ve found a regime that fits you well, you can “exploit” it, for accelerated gains compared to your peers. This process is known as “explore vs. exploit”. You should always have a bit of both in your life; likely more explore while your young, and exploit once you’ve found your groove.\n5/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"An Easy \u0026 Proven Way to Build Good Habits \u0026 Break Bad Ones","tags":["Books"],"title":"Atomic Habits","uri":"/books/202101atomichabits/"},{"categories":["Okay Books"],"content":"A collection of financial industry darlings speak openly about how they invest their money.

Their beliefs are self-fulfilling…\n  Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable…\n  Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage…\n  Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for, found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now…\n  Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you, but look like work to others… and is taught through apprenticeships, not school… often highly technical or creative, it cannot be outsourced or automated…\n  Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\n  Fortunes require leverage.

An extreme example of this last form of luck, as described in the book, is the following: “suppose you’re the best person in the world at deep-sea diving.

People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions. But creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I believe your environment is more likely to contribute more to your creative output than your genetic makeup.\nBut who cares what I think, let’s find out what science has to say. Specifically, let’s review a review: Research on Workplace Creativity (2000-2014). And besides learning what the research shows, we’ll learn how to shape your environment for the better.\nTL;DR: Everyone can be creative. Invest in leadership, team culture, and the individual’s environment.\nCreativity at the workplace Let us first pause, and consider if creativity at the workplace is a good proxy for creativity as a whole? Go ahead, think for yourself - is it?\n You probably skipped that, and just continued reading huh?\nWell, I believe it is a valuable proxy wherever creativity is needed within a team, IF that team has some financial incentive in their delivery. However, creativity as a solo show, or within a team without financial ends, could have different considerations, or simply not map onto these points. However, many of the points here are general, and seem like they should deliver value outside of the workplace too.\nAll this to say, this research isn’t an absolute truth for all circumstances.\nThe obvious A lot of the research had, in my opinion, obvious findings. But let’s not skip these points. It’s all too easy to get caught up in the nuanced or corner case findings, forgetting that the basics can get us where we needed to be.\nListing these points out, because I’m lazy, and this saves me valuable time from having to string these points together in comprehensive sentences:\n “Leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity” (duh).  Trustworthy leaders build team creativity.   All tasks should be given goals (but not too focused - use design thinking). Have positive belief in one’s capacity to perform their job. Autonomy is key (do not micromanage - again, duh). Moderate time pressure is good. “Allowing team members to tackle an idea-generation task individually first, before engaging in collective ideation led teams to generate ideas of higher quality.”  So this is a nice list of things to do, but what about things not to do?\nUnfortunately, the review didn’t really touch on that research because, well, how to suppress creativity isn’t well studied. I guess there isn’t much money in it? Go figure 🤷 However, there is one study mentioned. It showed knowledge hiding decreases an individual’s creativity.\n “The main and moderated effect of knowledge hiding on the knowledge hider’s creativity was mediated by distrust of another person and in turn that person’s own knowledge hiding”.\n In other words, do unto others as you’d have them do onto you. You hid information from them, they’ll hide it from you.\nThe nuanced Okay, so far, we’ve basically reminded ourselves why culture matters; why it benefits a team to have strong leadership, not micro manage, and be kind to ourselves and others. Probably all things that have a positive affect outside of creativity too.\nWhat are some more nuanced findings brought to light by this review? For starters, there are a few recommendations for leaders:\n Leaders sharing their inner struggles, and a broad amount of information, leads to trust and positive information sharing, which leads to creativity. “Leader inspirational motivation on creative effort (an antecedent of creativity) was more positive when leaders were highly prototypical, and more negative when leaders were less prototypical”. Leaders thought of as creative role models can boost creativity by displaying unconventional behaviour. Creativity should be declared as a desirable outcome.  When expecting creativity, employees perform more creatively. This positive effect was seen when expectations came from coworkers or family and friends too. A classic example of meeting the expectation placed upon us by others.    Two of my favourite takeaways here showcase how true it is that we are social creatures. That creative expectations placed on us by others, and leaders displaying unconventional behaviour both improve our creativity shows how much our minds are fueled by those around us.\nBeyond useful tips for people leadership, there are some team values that can foster creativity:\n Team diversity boosted creativity only when team members excelled in taking on other’s perspectives.  Create a diverse team, AND a culture of listening to ideas that aren’t yours, and maybe oppose your beliefs.   Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively affected individuals' belief in their creativity. Transformational leadership helps to unlock creativity in general, and is necessary to unlock creativity benefits brought on by diversity. Reward those who benefit others; “prosocial motivation” moderates intrinsic motivation for creativity.  Part of this motivation comes from a culture of help seeking. However, prosocial motivation comes at the expense of increased help giving, which negatively affects creativity.    Here we see a general theme arise. Having an environment where new ideas flow easily, free from echo chambers or dogmatic beliefs, elevates creativity for everyone involved. Fall prey to close mindedness or stop listening to new ideas, and you’re sure to take a hit to your creativity.\nThe context So far, these recommendations have been generally applicable. But what about the “actor–context” findings mentioned in the paper’s abstract? (yeah, you should probably open the paper I linked in the opening - how do you know this whole post isn’t just fake news?)\nHow might the same context affect people differently?\nFor example, the interplay of context and the individual leads to positive, or negative, or a mute impact on creativity. Let’s take a look:\n Benevolent leadership leads to creativity when autonomy is high, but NOT when job autonomy is low. For individuals with creative role identities (i.e., believing your results are delivered in part due to creative thinking), creativity was higher than peers only if organization support for creativity was perceived. If that support was perceived to be missing, their creative output was actually less than their peers. Individuals expecting an informational evaluation of their ideas performed better in their creativity when given a standard (or creative) example before working on a task. Conversely, individuals expecting a controlling evaluation of their ideas showed worse levels of creativity when given a standard example compared to no example at all! Moderate levels of competition fostered creativity within groups with stable membership (low levels of competition were bad, and high levels were no better than moderate). However, for groups that change frequently with new members, the effect of competition on creativity followed a U shape (good at low and high, but bad at moderate). To optimize creativity via social networks, you either want: i) high centrality and low outside ties, or ii) low centrality and high outside ties.  These examples highlight the need to consider each person, or their team, separately when trying to improve creativity. There is no “one size fits all” solution here, as we’d expect.\nAdditional research will shed light on trade-offs for team’s trying to optimize heavily in one dimension. For example, trusting relationships with leaders has a positive effect for team creativity with a learning goal orientation, through information exchange. However, if instead of a learning goal orientation, your team has a performance approach orientation, this same mechanism (information exchange + trust in leadership) actually results in a negative impact to creativity. Interestingly, this double-edged sword works in reverse as well, where less-trusting relationships with leadership had a positive impact on team creativity with performance approach orientation.\n Gong and colleagues (2012b) showed that having a trusting relationship with the leader moderated the indirect effect of team learning goal orientation on team creativity through team information exchange such that this indirect effect was positive when teams had a trusting relationship with their leaders, but it was not significant when trust was low. Interestingly, and underscoring the need to look at the interplay of the creative actor and the surrounding context, having a trusting relationship with the leader had the opposite impact on the indirect effect of a team’s performance approach orientation on team creativity through information exchange. This effect was more positive when members reported a less-trusting relationship with their leader and more negative when the relationship with the leader was more trusting.\n Environment engineering Clearly, the context which we find ourselves, or those we’re evaluating, is an integral part to success. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The more we’ve learnt about human behaviour, the more we understand how crucial one’s environment is to shaping who we are. As I mention in my takeaways to Malcom Gladwell’s book “Talking to Strangers”, Don’t judge a stranger, judge their environment..\nEmpowered by this idea, we can purposely shape our environments for the better. Allowing our context to deliver value day after day. I call this Environment Engineering (not to be confused with Environmental Engineering, although I do see the problem I’ve created for myself).\nIn the workplace, there are 3 primary environment changes we can make to improve creativity:\n Invest in your team’s culture. Incentivize information sharing, open mindedness, and seeking of diverse ideas for teams that have creative role identity. For example, have “information sharing”, and “inclusivity” as core competencies that employees (both leaders and makers) are evaluated against. Invest in leadership. Incentivize leaders to be vulnerable. Have them share genuine thoughts and feelings, both good and bad, which builds trust. Train leaders in transformational leadership and how to craft clear goals with design thinking. Invest in the makers. Give them ownership, resources and equipment to succeed. Encourage them to believe in their abilities, and support them to learn missing skills. You’ll see results aligned with expectations. Expect poor, non-creative output, and your makers will deliver; expect creative goodness, and you shall receive.  A couple of caveats: i) obviously leaders shouldn’t share sensitive company information that should be contained (i.e., poor performance of others, potential M\u0026A, etc.); ii) expecting greatness of an employee at all times is a high bar to reach, hence why I said goodness.\nAlso, I should clarify, a “maker” is an employee who makes (think associate), versus a “leader” who leads (think manager).\nDo not overlook the 1% improvement A king of environment engineering is Sir Dave Brailsford. He’s the man behind Britain’s dominance in cycling over the past decade.\nWhen he took over the cycling program, he got right to work improving the cyclist’s environment. He started with the obvious improvements you’d expect: testing various bike suites to optimize aerodynamics, reducing the weight of the bikes beyond what had already been done, and implementing biotracking during fitness routines to optimize for the individuals the next day.\nHe then went above and beyond these more obvious environment changes. He painted the inside of their bike transportation truck white to help spot dirt on bikes. He hired surgeons to teach the team proper hand washing technique to reduce sickness. And he had all bikers A/B test over 30 pillows so everyone had the perfect pillow they could take with them to events.\nThese minor changes, ever so small, had real dividends. Before Sir Dave Brailsford, Great Britain had never won the Tour De France. With him at the helm, they’ve won 6 of the last 10 titles.\n  When Sir Brailsford speaks about marginal gains, he reinforces context changes similar to what was suggested by this research paper:\n Create a positive culture. Everyone knows their responsibilities, achieves them for the betterment of the team (knowledge sharing \u0026 open mindedness). Hire for behaviour fit more than technical prowess, and teach where needed. Have strong leaders who can create those clear responsibilities and positive environments (clear problem statements - design thinking). Give people ownership (autonomy), and a supportive environment to succeed.  Note: much of this section was taken from a podcast interview from Sam Harris and James Clear. You should really listen to James speak about this topic, he’s the expert.\nBeyond the workplace Environment engineering isn’t for the workplace alone. It’s a very powerful tool for self improvement too. As outlined by James, habits are the compounding interest of self improvement.\n What are habits? they are the moment-by-moment decisions we make. How are decisions made? they are often the simplest choice to a current dilemma. What determines the simplest choice? the simplest choice is a function of your environment. Therefore, self improvement begins with improving your environment.  At a personal level, there is a ton of low hanging fruit anyone can do. For example, removing distractions from your environment can greatly improve focus by eliminating context switching. Try keeping your phone out of reach, with notifications off for everything except maybe phone calls or other possibly urgent forms of communication. Mute notifications for everything else.\nOr try working in an open space to fuel expansive thinking (a quiet park if your living arrangement cannot provide). If focus is what you need, maybe a closed-off dark room is preferable. Recognizing when you need to be alone, with your own thoughts, or together, sharing ideas, is another big environment change you can make.\nTry creating purposeful stress modulating reminders in your environment. Mindfulness meditation, and certain breathing exercises can quickly change your stress levels if they are unwantingly high. At times of unwanted stress, it can be hard to bring these tricks into the present moment. Maybe a poster, or a note, or a piece of artwork help ground you in times of unwanted stress. Add these reminders to your environment and practice using them.\nIf you’re new to mindfulness as a tool for stress management, I suggest trying the Waking Up meditation app. If you’re unsure what breathing exercises to do, review Andrew Huberman’s work.   In closing Everyone can be creative. As said in the closing remarks of the paper,\n Our review suggests that leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity. Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity.\n Beyond leadership, invest in the context your team operates within. Create a culture of information sharing, and open mindedness. Total knowledge on a team is not a summation game. The distribution of this knowledge matters.\nInvest in the maker’s environment. Find those 1% gains that deliver success day after day. Clear responsibility and autonomy are prerequisites, of course, but don’t stop there. What additional resources / environment changes can you provide that will give your team the edge to outperform?\nAppendix: My favourite run on sentence from the paper… gotta love peer reviewed literature:\n “The limited number of factors studied at both levels [individual and team] of analysis renders premature a general conclusion as to whether creativity is an isomorphous construct across levels of analysis that displays homologous relations with a broad range of antecedents”\n ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Creating Creativity and Environment Engineering","uri":"/posts/creativity/"},{"categories":["Good Books"],"content":"I agree with the book’s subtitle, this is definitely a mammoth overview of racist ideas in America. Starting with the racists ideas of colonial Europe that seeded the founding father, or white-religous-upperclassmen, as is more appropriate, up to Barack Obama, and some of the racist ideas he pondered aloud.\nIf you want to educate yourself on how poorly Black Americans have been treated by their peers and the policies in their society, look no further. It is a little long, but comes together quite nicely in the end. And it’s on Spotify as an audio book!\nMy key takeaway Basically, to talk of a person as being different from the rest of society because of something about their race/sex/gender/age/etc., rather than their environment, is wrong.\nI agree with the premise, and it is interesting to catch yourself being X-ist whenever you think thoughts upon a group. No individual should be stamped from the beginning. And, as discussed by Malcom Gladwell in Talking to Strangers, you SHOULD consider an individual’s environment. Think about how their environment has shaped them before concluding what is a reasonable thought, or conducting your behaviour.\nA discussion I’d like to start at the end. Ibram X. Kendi concludes with the following:\n “There will come a time when principled anti-racists are in power, and then anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racists ideas become the common sense of the people, and the anti-racists common sense of the people hold their anti-racists leaders and policies accountable.”\n I wholeheartedly agree. And like to think many people in power have thought themselves anti-racists, but, to this book’s credit, not been. Ibram shows exactly why not:\n “Self-interest leads to racist policies, leads to racist ideas, which leads to ignorance and hate.”\n Why is it that people elected into positions of power, literally charged to be other-interested, fail so miserably? Ibram claims it is because power is inherently self-interested. Power cannot make decisions that are against its self-interest. Otherwise, the power is lost.\nThis is true. However, his solutions: i) to educate those without power to band together and grow in strength, and ii) that non-white-religous-upperclassmen who are self-interested should fight for anti-racisms because it is the precursor to humanity for all, are remist. Both of these solutions are principled to the same ideas that lead the founding fathers. Namely, together, we are strong enough to take power from the powerful and only then will there be peace for all.\nDon’t get me wrong, I agree that “when we fight for humanity, we are fighting for ourselves.” And that we need principled anti-racists in power. And that we need to educate those without power the most of all. But the largest problem I see is not that education doesn’t work; it’s that our political system has totally fucked up incentives.\nLet us posit the job of our politicians to be caring for the entire population under their control, and the earth as a whole. That’s a tall order for any single person, so our politicians will need to work together to get the job done.\nClearly, there are many people involved, and to make progress will require alignment. Alignment of ideas requires, from time to time, the odd mind to be changed. This IS education. However, the problem arises whenever a needed solution is radically different from the accepted culture of the time. It is these moments that the powerful must decide between 2 choices:\n Push through a solution that degrades their influence with a majority of people, thus leading to their removal from power Compromise a solution that neither fixes the problem, nor lose too much favor with the public such that they keep power (for now)  This is the balancing act we ask of politicians, who rose to power off the piggy banks of individuals whose influence is yet another factor for the person in charge.\nWhat we need most of all is a new incentive system for our politicians. We need to remove donations from politicians' bank roles. We need to incentivize quality decisions that positively affect those who are losing the most, as measured by third parties.\nWe need reform of those who do the reforming.\nI believe education does work, we just need the right incentives.\n4/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America","tags":["Books"],"title":"Stamped From The Beginning","uri":"/books/202009stampedfromthebeginning/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"It was recently pointed out to me, by a dual citizen family member, that America has a lot to be proud of. For example, they have by far the most number of nobel laureates, founded many of the most profitable companies in the world, created the internet, and has had worldwide influenced on how democracy should operate.\nWe’d been discussing a Canadian classic, how we’re different from America. My stance was an air of elitism over America, because of their lacking liveable safety net and free health care. He agreed, but was quick to list the aforementioned achievements of the US, and questioned if their pedigree was fueled by their winner-takes-all society? In other words, could America have achieved as much world influence or innovation with more socially equal policies?\nYES Maybe they’d have achieved even greater success?\nWhy is it that American’s are so quick to be proud of their world dominance, without acknowledging how they got there? Surely they’d soften their bravado if colonial era wrongdoings were at the forefront of their history lessons. Not to mention the luck involved to finish World War 2 at the top (of the world).\nI argue that the amount of wealth generated by these two aspects of American history are far more consequential than their pro-wealth building policies.\nLet’s consider previous epicenters of world influence \u0026 innovation. Europe, before the US, was undergoing a scientific revolution. Worldwide commerce and colonialism had far reaching influence. Worse than the US, it privileged only a few monarchs, by taking from the masses. Free time for the elites sparked innovations in science and mathematics that did change the world. Like Newtonian mechanics, which gave European militaries the ability to precisely calculate projectile motion. Before Europe’s enlightenment, it was east Asian behemoth’s of the middle ages like the Byzantine empire and the Islamic world.\nIs it pro-wealth building policies, or accrued wealth that foster innovation and worldwide influence? It is understandable that many would answer “both”, but consider that throughout history, every nation state has had pro-wealth building policies. Yet, influence and innovation remained with the wealthy. Both Europe, and east Asia before them, had the money to hold power. Over time, that money is spent on the military to maintain power, until the money’s gone, and the power shifts.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is people. It’s not enough to simply have wealth, you also need a large marketplace to grow that wealth. The policies governing the massive marketplace do matter; monopolies are bad for the people, and capitalism has proven better than communism. But what I’m claiming is simply that wealth over wealth-generating policies leads to innovation and influence. Perhaps this is obvious, but if that is the case, why do American’s consistently claim to be the “greatest nation” because of their policies?\nThey should instead claim to be the greatest nation, because of the wealth they stole or lucked into This is a hugely different mindset. (A majority of?) American’s believe they created their success out of sheer will power. They did not. Their stolen wealth, off the back of colonial thievery, and mid-century luck put them on a path to dominance. They should be humble about the fortune they find themselves with. Instead, there is an air of deservedness that stifles humility, and reduces their social appetite to support the have nots.\nAmerican’s should be proud of their country, and work hard to recognize their errors, and their luck. They should stop idealizing the individual without also appreciating their privileged environment, and how their (white male) riches came to be.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Americans: should they be so proud?","uri":"/posts/america/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"Suppose you aren’t happy with how a housemate leaves the kitchen, or maybe they take up too much shared living space, and you’d like them to pay a little more if they want to keep owning the space.\nMaybe your significant other hides financial information from you, and you’re feeling the onset of financial abuse?\nWhatever the tough conversation is, have it now.

But I’d also be a totally different person than who I am.\nBeing money focused isn’t inherantly bad if your society values money. I’d say it’s a crucial component to success. Money is a resource, and managing your resources is a part of living a healthy life. Without resource managment, you run the risk of bad times when the going gets tough.\nI digress.

And while there are always trade-offs between pleasure now, or later, the goal is not to be the richest person in the cemetary.\n1 2 3  Life is something that happens in a flash. We just have a brief moment here, and then we're gone.   Satisfaction This is a constant battle; being satsified with what we have.\nIt is why life changes so drastically as we grow up. Why our childhood is different from our early adulthood (20-40), middle age (40-60), and later life. What we need to feel satisfied changes, and society does a bad job of teaching us how to speak up. How to diagnose and discuss disatisfaction is terribly tricky. Thankfully, listening to others can help!\n 65 reflect on 35. Desires -\u003e bain of budhism  Financial freedom, having a family, having a life partner, having good sex, having good health, the list goes on.   Listening to others to helps to focus our priority in this long list of desires. It also serves a purpose. Without desires, and the feeling of wanting more, we’d not progress. So be careful not to eliminate desires all together.  Western Democracy This needs fixing. Fuck gerymandoring. Fix the first past the pole. Incentivize voter turnout for more representation. Educate to limit ignorant voting. Remove lobbying for financial gain -\u003e but keep lobbying for positive change.\nThe Luck of Lemons in Life 1 2 3 4 5  Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.” The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.” The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.   This story of a Chinese farmer, presented by Alan Watts in a collection of lectures titled “Eastern Wisdom, Modern Life”, highlights the uncertainty of life wonderfully. Never knowing the consequence of (mis)fortune, is a lesson not often taught. Instead, young adults often learn only half this story through their own experience, to the detriment of their moral. That is, good fortune in one’s adolescence doesn’t necessarily lead to good fortune elsewhere. This is an obvious statement, and a massive generalization, but the idea here has massive consequences on our moral.\nTake for instance…\n great childhood -\u003e good first job, post-secondary school, love, or whatever is important to you overtime, the job stagnates, school sucks, the relationship becomes less fulfilling, or whatever maybe the slow down without a clear cause without a clear cause, the negative thoughts which resulted from a “positive situation” can grow; sometimes too large to be dealt with alone. But without a clear cause, it can seem easier to live in poorly designed moments that suppress the thoughts/feelings/situation, than work through the lemons on our head. But these lemons have power. This is the misfourtune that leads to fortune. Although it is impossible to know how long we have between the cycles, it is guaranteed that our brains bounce back. Mother nature is sneaky, she hardwired adaptive architure into the mainframe, so our software is never done updating. It is impossible to know how the hard times will change us, or which doors will open because of it. But it is certain that your situation will improve. In the meantime, talk about bad times, for they are real and need addressing. But keep your moral up too - for without it, you are harder to help, and slower to see the positive change happening around you.

Emoji","uri":"/snippets/markdownemojis/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"This book is an epic undertaking, showcasing world history up to the early 2010’s, through the lense of the silk road. History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their ideas in a cohesive framework. The thesis presented here outlines how resource transportation routes shaped our world history. Equally important to the goods flowing through commerce were new ideas, including religions, and a massive game of political chess. Short term policies crafted to maintain power at the expense of those without it, often led to self destruction through overreach (and over spending). Worse still was the long term instability created by dying powers' abrupt departure from battleground regions. The most shocking lesson I took away is how cyclical our world history is. The fight for power, and abhorrent disregard for others by those trying to maintain it, is the saddest trait we share.\nThe book starts off slow, but is worth persevering through. It started about 2000 years ago, with the empire of Persia, and the creation of the silk roads.

Welcome to a few of my favourite things ☺️ It’s just a collection of thoughts and ideas that I wanted to keep.\nWho am I? The short answer is a Canadian who loves too many things for his own good. Friends \u0026 family, science, philosophy, sports, engineering, video games, coding, self improvement, meditation, cooking, travelling, investing… the pursuit of happiness? You get the idea.\nThe downside to too many interests is that I’m not the best at anything, BUT, that was never the goal.\nThings I’m proud of  Canada - summarized well by Tobi Lütke’s article The case for swagger: Canadians have a lot to be proud of. Two years of my life spent learning about the Theory and Modelling of Light-Matter Interactions in Photonic Crystal Cavity Systems Coupled to Quantum Dot Ensembles - aka my Thesis title. Juniper Creates, a successful Canadian ecommerce service for influencers. I was one of 4 cofounders, but left the company in 2017 to pursuit a career in data science. Juniper’s success since then has been due to the cofounders who stayed (and the team they built!), but I’m still very proud for the parts I played. You’ll still find me at Juniper events or team meetings 😃 This blog! I think?  The long answer… Fair warning, the remainder of this page is a long answer to the question: who are you?\nAs you’ll find shortly, I am a bit of an open book. However, without a clear audience in mind, the following is quite a ramble. This is probably for future me to see how past me thought about young me. More likely, you’re not future me, but maybe you’ll enjoy learning a bit more about my life! Or not. That is fine too. I wrote a lot.\nGrowing up 😇 I grew up in Toronto (well, North York if you know the difference), in a quietish neighbourhood. I had what I imagine is a normal upper-middle class upbringing. Lots of sports, summer camps, hanging out with friends and playing video games. Both my parents were engineers, working at Ontario Power Generation where they met. They’re retired now, enjoying a very social 60’s.\nI was good at school, but not uniformly. This was especially apparent prior to high school. I remember in grade 7, thinking my parents only used math and science at work, and so considered other subjects less useful. “Why learn poetry?” I asked my English teacher. “So you can tell girls how much you love them”. This answer did not fly with me. Who cared about girls?! Well, I did, but no way would I let them know it.\nIf English class was hard, French was impossible. I dropped it as soon as I could, which in hindsight, was a bad move. Now 27, I need to learn French in preparation for a sabbatical with my bilingual girlfriend.\nMath had its challenges, but when I tried, I could usually figure it out. I wasn’t the kid who “just got it”, but I’m happy about that. I think it taught me empathy, which is a hard skill to refine if you don’t struggle in some way. I also learnt that learning is hard, but always possible. And that a good (patient) teacher makes a huge difference.\nFinally, I was remarkably lucky to have great experiences at all the grade schools I went to. All 3 were Toronto public schools, 1-6, 7-8, and 9-12 in good neighbourhoods (certainly a factor). Some teachers were more memorable than others, but the biggest impact on my time in grade school was that my friend group remained largely intact. From about grade 3 onwards, I hung out with the same group of boys, and still have most of them as best friends today.\nIn grade 12, our group was 8 boys large, and 5 of us all decided to go to Queen’s together. So began the next chapter.\nUniversity 😝 Math and science drew me to engineering, but I had no idea what kind. I had previously done well in biology and physics, so I thought biomechanical engineering would be a good fit. Fortunately, first year engineering at Queen’s was a general education, so I had some time to figure it out.\nAs I researched the 4th year courses available to a biomech eng, none were spiking my interest. However, there was this cool degree: Engineering Physics, with an electrical option that had 4th year courses like biomedical physics. Also, Laser Physics! Who didn’t want to learn how lasers work? As a final selling point, one of my high school best friends was planning to study Engineering Physics as well. That we’d be living together the next 3 years made it all too easy to pick my major.\nBesides choosing Engineering Physics as my major, first year showed me the power of teamwork. To do well in engineering, teamwork was necessary. No one could succeed academically (or party) on their own. Queen’s eng was a work hard, play hard culture. Looking back, it’s funny how memorable the parties were, while the studying is certainly a blur.\nThen came my first 4 months summer, and my first office job. I hated it. The people were wonderful, but they had no work to give me. My average day as the “summer intern” was:\n Wake up at 7:15 Get to work by 9 Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - usually the answer was no Complete the work, if any, taking ~ 30-60 minutes Wait until lunch (I had a laptop with internet, but had to look like I was doing things) Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - again, no Wait until 5 so I could leave Get home around 6, eat dinner, relax for an hour or two before bed  I never knew how boring it could be to be paid to do nothing, while needing to be “visible”. Truly mind-numbing. There is only so much escape the internet can provide.\nSecond year saw my first long term (1.5 year) relationship end. It was entirely my fault. I had been having doubts about the relationship for a few months, but was totally unable to share them out of fear that’d be too hurtful. Instead of working through the issues, I let the emotions bottle up, until one day everything just kind of came out, very much by accident. As I left her house, knowing we’d “broken up” without actually having said those words, I felt freedom. Having been a prisoner of my mind for so long, I forgot how calming life is when you can share unhappy thoughts openly.\nI also discovered some wicked cool math in second year, but that’s a conversation for another day.\nThe summer between 2nd and 3rd year was the best summer of my life. I was a camp instructor at Science Quest, a Queen’s science camp for kids. And I loved it. The first 2 weeks began with us creating hands-on learning modules. Each one would teach part of the science curriculum for Ontario schools grades 3-8, and every grade had a different module that took 2.5 hours to present. We’d toured schools across Ontario, some as far as a 5 hour drive north of Kingston. Teachers loved it, the kids loved it, and luckily, I loved it too. Every grade was different, every school was unique, but I never had a bad class. Even the kids who were too cool for our content would perk up after the introductory “wow-em” - a short demonstration of the subjects power in the real world. For example, the wow-em I put together for a structures module (grade 4 I believe) was to stand on an empty soda can with all of my weight. A volunteer would then lightly touch the side with a ruler, and instantly, my weight crushed the can to nothing. If you’ve never done this, it’s actually a lot of fun. The key is to make sure your soda can has no blemishes and is perfectly smooth. Also, make sure your weight is evenly distributed, and you should be able to stand up no problem (I weighed about 180 pounds)! Whoever lightly touches the can is always surprised that something so strong can crumble so easily. Structural weak points are cool.\nJuly \u0026 August turn Science Quest into a summer camp, with new kids each week. The content was similar, just with a lot more touch points for each kid. One of the biggest challenges was helping kids with disabilities learn, and more importantly, play nicely with everyone else. For all the effort we put in to making their lives a little better, we received equal parts appreciation from their families. The challenges faced by families who take care of loved ones with disabilities are not for the faint of heart, but the love it generates can be truly special.\nI also had a family vacation where I went scuba diving for the first time (it was amazing), AND went skydiving with my summer group of Queen’s friends near Kingston (equally amazing). Both of those are stories for another day, but I will say to anyone who’s on the fence about either activity: do it. 10/10 you will never forget those moments and they are wild.\nThird year was an epic journey of mind blowing physics (Quantum mechanics is fun when you have a good teacher), and a new, healthy relationship. I’d learnt a lot from my first relationship, and was on a high from my summer fun. I also knew I needed to find a way to stay in Kingston for the next summer, and so I applied to various academic positions. One in particular was a physics research position that would turn my 4th year thesis project into an accelerated masters thesis. I’d have to stay at Queen’s 1 more year, but that actually seemed like a good idea since my girlfriend was 1 year behind me. And so I started my masters in the summer between 3rd and 4th year.\nPhysics Overload 😵 Unfortunately, my masters had nothing to do with medical physics. It was theoretical nanophotonics, the study of light matter interactions in nano-sized objects. I had chosen the subject too quickly. In part, I was fearful I’d not find another Kingston employment opportunity for the summer; but also, I was happy to be done with my job search (I’d applied to a few non-academic postings that didn’t pan out).\nDon’t get me wrong, there was a lot of cool stuff I learnt. A LOT. But I never loved the subject the way you need to, to excel in academia. There were a few times I thought about switching out, moving to the electrical department to pursue something a little more hands on, but I couldn’t overcome the sunk cost mentality of the many months I’d already put into the program.\nI did get a peak into an academic career path, which is an incredible life if you love the material. But there is a lot of grant work, and the potential mismatch between “rock solid researcher” and “university professor”. Not to mention, it’s a very long journey. Most of my peers finished a masters (~2 years) before starting their PHD, which then took ~5 years on average. At this point, you’re looking for 1-2 postdoctoral research roles, which have a lot of competition, and are generally much more expensive for the prof to fund, limit the availability, and create incentives for professors to keep a steady stream of PHD candidates coming through their door. IF you make it through all the necessary training, let’s say in ~10 years, you’re still not guaranteed a professor posting will open up in your field. Let alone the country/province/city/university you’re most interested in.\nHaving said all of this, understanding hard unsolved problems, and hopefully how to solve them, is a forever skill. Though you might not use your research if you switch career paths halfway through, the learned ability to learn is forever transferrable. I guess the more time you spend in school, the more you refine this skillset.\nAlso, playing with start-of-the-art anything is cool too. Oh, and numerical methods are the real heros of applied theoretical physics.\nOn a more personal side, I went through my second long-term (1.5 years) break up midway through 4th year. This time the ending was mutual, as she was going on exchange, and we knew our relationship had problems that needed addressing. Timing and geography were our downfall, but we kept in touch and maybe could have gotten back together. Instead, we both found new relationships that summer.\nMy 3rd long term (1 year) relationship was the first time I was introduced to right-wing politics. It was very impactful for me to strongly engage in political conversation with someone who’s mind I wanted to change. At the same time, there were some good points she raised, and I discovered how different a story is presented, depending on the political ideology of the news source. Nowadays, I’m a big fan of central/agnostic new outlets, or, will try to consume media from both sides. The undoing of this year long love story had a messy ending, content for another post. All you need to know is that my 2016 summer was coming to a close, but I could already tell, this was one of my worst years yet.\nI was supposed to have graduated in September, the bulk of my thesis was done, but my research results were incomplete. I just needed a few more simulations to run to cover corner cases in my numerical theory. I woke up everyday feeling so close to the finish line, yet my professor was adamant my paper be submitted before I defend my thesis, and that couldn’t happen without these results. As the weeks went by, I began to question if I’d ever graduate.\nBroken up with, and worried I’d never graduate with the degree I no longer cared about, the last four months of 2016 were a struggle. So I decided to do what anyone else would do, and began building a company with my roommate Nikita.\nA start up 😯 He was something of a serial entrepreneur at the time, already having founded 2 other companies. The new idea of his was to use Shopify to build his brother, Denis (a growing YouTube star), an ecommerce website. This first test store was a surprising success, bringing in a few hundred dollars a month! It was mostly surprising because Denis had a small-ish following of less than 100K subscribers. Hearing how an ecommerce store could bring in an extra few hundred dollars a month, Denis’s fellow YouTube friends wanted Nikita to make them a store too. And so Imprint Creations was born, with Nikita at the helm, and myself brought in as his cofounder.\nWe were a two man team, with very different day jobs. Nikita was busy running his second start up by day, while I was at the lab running my simulations. By night, we’d build out new stores, reply to customer emails, and contract designers to create new products. By January, we’d sold enough merchandise to convince ourselves that this was truly a company, and worth our full attention.\nNikita knew another start up in the YouTube space, Juniper, who’s cofounders (Joel and Ryan) were working out of The Next Big Thing - a Vancouver based incubator. The four of us met virtually, and within the hour, decided we had real collaboration potential. They invited us to share their free office space, while we worked out the details.\nGlossing over a few considerations I had at the time: i) earlier in the summer of 2016, I’d been hired as a ski technician at Whistler for the 2017 Winter season; ii) I’d been hired as a Data Scientist at Capital One through campus recruiting, to start post graduation; iii) I had to defend my masters thesis January 23rd. What to do…\nAlthough I’d dreamed of being a ski bum, working on this start up was the clear choice. Whistler was out, but Vancouver was in! Capital One thought I was graduating in May, so I had the offer start date set to September 2017. Tons of time to figure out if I’d actually want to go there, or remain a cofounder (it was not).\nAnd so the plan was set, I’d work remotely in Ontario till my thesis was successfully defended (23rd) and submitted (27th). Then join Nikita and the Juniper boys in Vancouver (30th). Landing in Vancouver began a new journey with renewed focus and excitement. The full story of Vancouver and Imprint Creations is for another time, but I will say 2017 was the best year of my life.\nThe biggest challenge came in the summer. Do I continue to build this company with Nikita, or leave and start a career as a data scientist? At the time, data science was leading the 21st century career hype train. I was also beginning to miss the math, modelling and application of data. A lifetime in accademia wasn’t my future, but using data sure would be. In comparison, the day-to-day work of the start up was mostly relationship management. Uncertain which choice was “correct”, I decided to go where the learning was most pronounced. Thankfully, Nikita was sympathetic to my dilemma, and made it easy for me to transition out of the company.\nMy departure left Nikita a one man show, but Juniper was struggling with a similar problem. Ryan was off to work at Amazon, and Juniper was out of cash. The money was flowing for Imprint, mainly because Denis had skyrocketed his YouTube channel over that first year. Clearly, the business worked if your influencer was a big fish. The trouble, of course, was out muscling tons of competition to win the big fish influencers. Joel thought if they could figure out that formula, we’d be in business. And so Joel and Nikita merged Juniper and Imprint to pursue the mission of A premium merchandising solution for the world’s largest influencers.\nIn 2018, I had little involvement with our company, but returned in 2019 with a part time role as “head of culture”. Now known as Juniper Creates, we continue to grow, and have been on the lucky side of COVID. That is, we’re a fully remote company, who’s entire business is selling products via ecommerce.\nI digress. Returning to August of 2017, I emailed Capital One requesting to push out my start date 1 month, so I could travel. I figured there was no point in lying, and told them I’d been working on a start up the whole summer, and wanted a mini vacation before picking up the corporate life. I wasn’t sure what my response would be, but was delighted when they said yes. I’ve come to learn that this flexibility is one of the best parts of working for a large corporation. I don’t know why more people don’t take advantage of it?\nI spent the month travelling Argentine and Chile with my older sister, who was living in Bueno Aires at the time. Again, a story for another time, but the month was exactly what I needed before diving into a completely new world of corporate finance.\nBig corporation life with big data 😌 Everything was slower, yet more precise. I have never witnessed a “business decision” that didn’t involve multiple people, some form of modelling, and an expected financial impact - with a sensitivity analysis, of course.\nMy role as a “data scientist” has not been what most people would think of, when they hear that job title. I have not been prototyping new models, to be better predictors than the competition, nor have I been maintaining existing models to remain finely tuned with daily trends. In fact, I’ve done almost zero model work beyond simple net present value calculations. This is not to say Capital One doesn’t have data scientists working on state-of-the-art models, we do. It’s more that my role should have been titled “data expert”.\nDepending on what team I’m supporting, I’ve been a data analyst, business analyst, data engineer, or Python engineer (I prefer to say Python over software since I’m not developing apps, GUIs, or resilient always-on systems; instead I create data tools in Python). And who knows, maybe my next rotation will be within the modelling team? The point is, there is much more than modelling that large enterprise organizations need done.\nIn my experience, good work has been measured by how well I’m able to straddle the business and tech worlds. Understanding the business problem, really getting into the nitty gritty, and improving the process is some way. Spoiler alert, the answer always involves data.\nI’ve also come to recognize there are many paths “up” at a large company. So far, mine has relied on rock solid communication, and a greater capacity to teach than my average peer. Thinking back to my favorite jobs, science instructor at Science Quest and being a TA for Dr. James Fraser, it makes sense that I’ve gravitated towards teaching. I think to be a strong teacher, you have to have struggled in some way to have learnt the material yourself. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself at a lose why others are facing roadblocks in the first place.\nFinally, I will forever admire Capital One for the amazing culture they’ve created. Learning is a priority, having open and honest conversations is a priority. Teaching managers to be great people leaders is a priority. All of these things make it easy to feel like you belong, and feel like you’re valued. The work isn’t the “sexiest”, which is particularly true for credit cards (the only product in Canada), and even more pronounced for those of use who were trained as engineers. I definitely miss the workshop and lab resources, where I could create a physical product, from idea to working prototype.\nIn summary, so far? I feel so fortunate to have seen how data is used in 3 very different career paths: the applied science academic, the ecommerce entrepreneur, and the big bank enterprise.\nI see the largest factor influencing how data is viewed being the goals each sector has.\nAcademia has the greatest attention to detail, fueled by their goal to uncover the truth. Mathematical rigor, peer reviews, world-wide collaborations, and long time horizons move academia into the future with better certainty than for-profit enterprises.\nNext is big corporations, motivated to apply data anywhere that is profitable. And boy is it profitable to apply it everywhere. When you’re a huge company, saving 1 hour per week per person in automatable computer tedium, or $1 per customer with better risk scores or marketing analytics adds up quickly. However, time is money, and decisions need to be made. The solution to this is tests, which themselves require a lot of monitoring to make sure the right programs are selected in the long term. All in all, more data is being produced, consumed, and acted upon more quickly, but this is a result of their scale. Their motivation is profit, which makes for an impatient parent when compared to “uncover the truth”. Hence, one should be wary of results whenever big companies are funding the studies.\nIn last place, we have the entrepreneur. Their world is so fast, so network based, that no one has time to mull over the data. This isn’t to say data isn’t important, it is. You need to know your key performance indicators inside and out. But most dashboards are primitive, data production poor, and calculations done back-of-the envelope. Most of your time is spent proving the idea is profitable, or delivering your MVP, and then scaling (i.e., hiring the right team).\nFor medium sized companies, since I’ve not worked at one, I cannot say for certain; BUT, I assume they’d fit between the start-up and big corp in terms of data use.\nBye! Anywho, that is me in a nutshell! Or at least, the 2020 me who is currently writing this. Honestly, I don’t expect anyone to read this whole thing, so if you did, WOW! Also, why?

Emotion makes conversation, well… human. But, where does emotion get us when we’re making decisions for others? And not just one or two other people, but a collective. What is the value of emotion, when we’re making decisions for an organization, a city, a country, or the world?\nThere clearly isn’t a black or white answer to this question. But I think this exercise, asking ourselves what value our emotions bring to decisions about many others, is worth thinking about.\nListening to others When we’re having conversations, emotions can be as powerful as the words themselves. Tone can differentiate comedy from cruelty, or desire from despise. It can stay with us, change us, in a way an emotionless conversation cannot.\nClearly, emotion is a valuable asset to good conversation. It directs our attention in powerful ways.\nConversations about policy The conversations that lead to decisions affecting many people are never easy. It is often the case that the decision generating the most impact is the most expensive. There are always trade offs.\nThe best decisions are ones that understood the whole picture. Better still if those involved can be honest and transparent; accepting the compromises they made to push for progress in their sphere of influence.\nGreater impact decisions take longer to make, as more voices are heard. This is why large companies move slow \u0026 startups move fast. It is also why governments take so long to make change (on top of their human resources completely changing every 4-8 years - but that’s another topic).\nUsing our emotion Our policies are made by humans. Whenever humans are making decisions for other humans, the bias of those making the decision is omnipresent. A healthy decision process will acknowledge this, and try its best to reduce bias. But our cognitive bias is a nasty bugger. Even if we pay attention to possible gotcha’s in our minds-eye, our subconscious will apply our bias to our emotions.\nTo remove our bias from decisions, we need to turn off our emotions.\nCan they hear you? Without emotion, the round table of decision makers is one where everyone’s opinion can change. Without bias, everyone should also be a better listener.\nBut without emotion, how well are new ideas heard? Can the decision makers empathize properly if they’ve turned off their emotional antennas? Likely not very well.\nClearly, there remains a need for emotion at the decision table.\nThe value of emotion in policy Listen to others with emotion. Hear what is being said, and understand as many legitimate viewpoints as possible.\nMake decisions without emotion. Know that when you’ve made a choice, it was without (much) bias, and a clear head.\n","description":"","subtitle":"How much is good to have?","tags":null,"title":"The value of emotion in policy","uri":"/posts/emotion_in_policy/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"This book was truly a wonderful read! If you want to learn about math’s history, you will love this book 💕\nYou do not need to have a strong background in math to get the full punch from this story.\nMy favourite takeaways Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is the concept that, over time, event likelihood converges on the average result. Said another way, whenever an outlier occurs, there’s a good chance that the next event will be closer to the main outcome.\nThis idea has interesting implications within the workplace. Manager’s are stung when praising outstanding work that is followed by normal work; whereas chastising bad work is usually followed by better performance. However, neither the praise nor the reprimand likely had as large of an effect as regression to the mean.\nNormal Distribution The normal distribution is the result of randomness.\n Whenever you see a normal distribution not caused by randomness, be suspicious. When you carefully measure something, if you do not see a normal distribution where randomness should occur (i.e., measurement error), you have likely destroyed the randomness that should be present.  5/5.\n","description":"","subtitle":"Dispatches from the Wonderful World of Mathematics","tags":["Books"],"title":"Alex’s Adventures in Numberland","uri":"/books/202004alexadventurenumberland/"},{"categories":["Best Books"],"content":"Using a mix of data and in-depth investigations around high profile human interactions, where human behaviour is interpreted terribly, we learn some very important lessons.

Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.\nIf no one wants to pre-order a free prototype your offer is not valuable enough.\nReorganization Random actions change things. Attempt to reorganize ideas is our body’s way of searching for solutions. When reference levels are violated, and we do not know what action to take next, try reorganization.\nSimulations in your brain only works well with a goal.\nEnvironment Easiest way to change things is by changing your environment.\nReference Levels Humans do not have easily manipulated behavior. We are too complex for that.\nRather we have reference levels that, when out of whack, force us to make change.\nReinterpretation What do you want to change your beliefs (or mental stimuli) simply follow:\n Recall that belief in as much detail. Think of alternative interpretations for that. Realize your belief is an interpretation, not fact. Discard your belief. Choose an alternative interpretation.  Motivation Either moving towards or away from things.\nWe evolved to prioritize moving away, which makes sense from our ancestors point-of-view, but doesn’t serve us as well today. Understand this emotional tug-of-war when making decisions.\nAs we prioritize moving away, we focus on what is being lost. This can make us fearful of change, because we aren’t understanding the complete picture.\nSelection Test Environmental constraints that determine which systems can be self perpetuating and which ones die.

Teaching folks what they want to learn is an example; providing them a useful tool is another. When thinking about creating value for myself, I often focus on wealth creation. I’m not sure why TBH. One guess is that more wealth allows me to place bigger bets, and subsequently more wealth creation. However, it is a fools errand to think there is a goal here. There is no winning in wealth creation, and the reward system is built on taking risks, which’ll include losses. Business value is generated by providing society something it is willing to pay for, or purchasing goods worth more tomorrow than you paid today. Societal value is the improvement of our lives. This means something different for everyone, but generally boils down to happiness/health/wealth and sex. Finding work that intersects these value systems is incredibly tricky.

And I think she is probably right.\nOur society is amazing for a select few, pretty sweet for a majority, and then terribly broken for billions of people. To roll the dice, and potentially wind up in the broken category, is not a worthwhile risk when the alternative is to live amongst an ancient community, who likely live in far greater equality (albeit, far worse conditions). So much of our happiness is derived by comparison to our neighbours, which leads me to believe the overall happiness of a random person’s life was probably higher in ancient times than today.\nLet’s assume I am right, and we are less happy today.

However, they are very, very different in their approach, and their outcome. It is hard to argue which is better, starting from scratch obviously allows for greater flexibility, but that can result in lost functionality of the previous model that had been working well.\nAt the end of the day, I think both of these ways to fix our systems should be done in tandem. This is commonplace at large organizations, where engineering teams often work to maintain the existing model, while a separate team create a complete new solution to the problem, with breaking changes that cause incompatibility. There is a period of time that both solutions are active, but eventually, the old system dies, and the cycle of improvement continues.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/back_to_the_future/"},{"categories":null,"content":"TODO: flush out the top here Do you ever feel that consumerism has gotten out of hand? Would we have the same environmental challenges, political battles over regulations, wealth inequality, or global power struggles without it?\nSometimes, when I ponder these big questions, I find myself scapegoating consumerism as the root cause. My train of thought goes something like this: [insert big picture challenge] changes by the decisions made by those with power -\u003e power is held by the decision made by the masses (elections, armies fighting for nations or militias, or the exchange of wealth) -\u003e i) elections are won in largepart by their funding money; ii) militaries are only as strong as the coin backing them; iii) wealth is money -\u003e everything to do with power requires money -\u003e money requires an exchange to be made for it to work -\u003e exchanging of something is consumption of that thing -\u003e [big picture challenge] relies on consumerism. Something, something capitalism, something.\nIf only we were all buddhists!\nHowever, think about what you’d be doing right now if not living in society of consumption. At worst, that society is a dictatorship or hateful monarch, at best it’s hunter-gather societies of ~150 humans or so.\nLet’s be nice to ourselves and picture life within that hunter-garther tribe. What would we be doing? Well, I for one, would probably be finishing my hunting and gathering in the morning to spend the afternoon relaxing or playing. And what would relaxing look like? Or playing? Probably making tea, smoking native plants, and conversing with my fello tribespeople. Ideally, somewhere communal and comfortable. Maybe we’ve built a clay couch or wooden chair. And what playing would probably involve some object, perhaps a rough ball made of vines or collection of evenly sized sticks.\nThe point is, I’d probably be consuming! To think, we’ve gone from consuming nicer barries/teas, to starbucks coffee, fastfood, synthetic physodelics, electric cars, trips around the world, and miniture 20th century super computers capable of ordering anything from anywhere at anytime.\nSure, we’ve swapped some nasties along the way. Instead of being at the mercy of 150 people you know well, we’re pressured by our society in ways beyond our control; or instead of being killed by a tiger, we’re forced to fight a war we don’t care much about, sometimes dying in our attempt to escape. We’ve even created new terrible things, like social media influenced suicide, or nuclear bombs. Yet, on average, fewer people die today than in any past life. Possibly hunter-gather tribes were more wholesome to live in, but who knows? Maybe the negative consquences of consumerism have been with our species since day one. All we can do is sit back, and enjoy the fruits of our 10,000 years of species history.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/consumerism/"},{"categories":null,"content":"WIP Decision making is an art; frameworks provide some structure.\nEven without trying, you’re using some mental model to make your decisions. Should you make dinner tonight, or order in? Based on your goals (lose weight, try something new, support local, save money), your habits (subconcious short cuts that try to make a quick decision for you), and your environment (your peers preference, availability of food at home vs good restraurants nearby, etc.) you’ll arrive at your decision. If you’re asked, “how did you decide?”, you might be able to list off 1 or 2 key contributing factors, but you’re unlikely to articulate the full nuance of your mental model as it works in real time.\nIf you can communicate a framework, it becomes much easier to make the “right decision”, whatever that may be to you (or your team). At their core, a framework is just an agreed upon way of thinking about problems. So you’re already using them everyday. The question isn’t if you use frameworks (AKA mental models), it’s do you understand them?\nIf you find yourself struggling to make a decision, or your team isn’t on the same page, take a step back from the solutions, and discuss frameworks.\n What do you value? What does success look like? What are the objectives? Is there a priority? What is being done for similar problems elsewhere? Should you change their framework? How do you vet information, and share knowledge? How do you handle indecision?  For example, Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a poweful framework for quickly communicating your teams framework. The what (objectives) and how (measuring progress) are clear. Consider stacking mental models, and creating new ones. To test your work, multiple parties should arrive at the same solution, if they’re using the same mental model(s). If not, the model isn’t clear enough, and needs refinement.\nWhen there isn’t enough time for this excercise, you’ll be making decisions based on habit. That is, your subconcious. Your biases will come into play, and your solutions might suffer.\nBy using frameworks, you leave a trail for future you to revist, and improve. So next time your faced with a problem, ask yourself, “what framework am I using?” You might just improve the art of decision making.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/frameworks/"},{"categories":null,"content":"WIP Happiness is subjective. Yet, I’ve noticed some patterns that are hopefully worthwhile to understand.\n  What brings us happiness changes over time. In our childhood, it is freetime (aka play time). In our middle age, it becomes progress. In old age I’m honestly not sure what brings people happiness. Maybe it is their lifes wisdom that brings them happiness, aka, every moment you’re mind is still working 🤷.\n  Progress is only half the story. The other half is love. Loving someone deeply, and knowing they love you is all one needs to be happy. The Shakespearian love. However, not everyone can attain such a strong love. Once it becomes clear that you’ll be living a life without Shakespearian love, your focus becomes capaitalistic in nature. Love that places the emphasis on how you look, rather than who you are. This love can often (but not always) be bought. This love is very different from Shakespearian. Society sells us the story that both can be atained, and for a lucky few, that is true. But for most, you go down either path…\n  ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/happiness_in_your_20s/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Working title Understanding human psychology can profoundly change your life. That you, and everyone you’ve met have multiple versions of their self (let’s call these “self-states”), is why you should never be too hard on humans.\nControl over one’s self-states is a commonality between high-performing individuals. Lacking the ability to move betweeen appropriate states of self is often viewed quite negatively by society, but it shouldn’t be. It should be viewed compassionately, with solutions rather than ridicule or anger. Psychedelics are showing promise as one potential tool for such people. The creation of new habits through environmental design could be another.\nFor example, a customizable “mood rings” linked to our phones could serve to reinforce our desired self-states by modifying our physical, digital, and emotional states all at once. Other physical objects could accomplish a similar task, however rings are discrete, highly personizable, and easily removed. Removing the ring would be equivalent to muting your phone. Having it on would constitute a self-state you’re engaged with. Working, socializing, creativity, play, listening, etc.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/selfstates/"},{"categories":null,"content":"TODO: add headers\nVery interesting podcast about how revolutions, changes in society that affect every part of society, are reliant on investement. And, how invest into “the next revolution” isn’t available until the past revolution no longer delivers strong capital gains.\nSome of the mentioned past revolutions were the industrial (coal/oil, massive engineering, steel, electricity, etc.), the telephone, and the internet. Interestingly, it is quite hard for the winners of past revolutions to create the next one, because of how many large fixed costs rely on the current revolution. For example, AT\u0026T was pitched the internet (a decentralized connection node network) before it was prototyped by the US military. They simply couldn’t understand how creating a decentralized network would be profitable, given their monopoloy of a closed network. Similarly, IBM, in their infancy, thought the entire world would only need 3 computers to complete the various “computer needs”. IBM was stuck in the electrical revolution, without realizing the world-wide-web was around the corner.\nSo, what is the next revolution to the internet? Well, you can be sure it’ll take up a lot of capital, and that it won’t receive funding until the internet and it’s subsequent technological advancements / capital gains are dried up.\nThat may seem ways away, but I believe it is already here. Most innovation joins multiple pieces of the complex global resources of “things” together. The internet could not happen without first the telephone, nor the telephone without first the industrial revolution, and so on. Think about all the funds currently directed to drastically changing transportation (space, underground travel, electric cars - basically, everything Musk), communication (also Musk with Neurolink; or the various attempts of quantum computers), energy (fusion \u0026 other renewables), fincance (block-chain), or medicine (?).\nRevolutions are made by connecting existing idea’s with a sales pitch that provides explosive levels of investment, AND return. Bets are currently being placed, and new bets will continue to be placed, until the next revolution is clear.\nPersonally, I think the next revolution is in AR/VR. Only time will tell!\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar’s Blog","uri":"/wip/the_next_revolution/"}]
