      <title>The Future of AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book has maybe two interesting parts to it. The description of how a new antibiotic was discovered by AI, and the modelling of protein folding by AI. Other than that, the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail about AI, and instead focuses on ideas like the cyber threat of AI, and how it is that that cyber threat is different from say nuclear threat. I suppose those would be interesting topics to folks more politically inclined than me. I just wanted to explore cutting edge AI and its novel impacts, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t get from this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Sovereign Individual</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I only skimmed this book, read about 1/3 of the content, but felt I got the gist. The authors outline what they think a future without government power will look like, as power shifts to individuals in the information age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individuals will be able to insulate themselves from governments in ways previously impossible. Work, communications, assets, and banking systems will be fully digital, allowing life to move wherever the individual desires.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
