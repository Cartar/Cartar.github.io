                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Very engaging book. In addition to learning about the power of habits, you&amp;rsquo;ll also learn to recognize what parts of your life are good/bad habits and how to build/break them. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid framework for everyone to understand, regardless of your goals. Best of all, this book keeps you engaged from chapter 1 with well told anecdotes and analogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-takeaways&#34;&gt;My takeaways:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small changes often appear to make no difference, until you&amp;rsquo;ve crossed some critical threshold. A hallmark feature of compounding gains. You need to be patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To improve your results, focus on your system, not the goals themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To improve your system, focus on your identity. You become your habits. Therefore, changing your habits requires you to change your identity. Are you someone who wants to do X, or are you someone who is doing X?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any habit can be broken down into a 4-step feedback loop: que, craving, response, and reward. To effectively change behaviour, simply target one of the 4 parts of the feedback loop: i) make it obvious; ii) make it attractive; iii) make it easy; iv) make it satisfying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point &amp;amp; call the action to make it clear what is happening &amp;amp; its consequences. I.e., I am opening a new tab and typing &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; out of habit, this will take me to reddit if I press enter where I&amp;rsquo;ll have some fun but likely spend too much time and regret having come in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;habit stacking&lt;/strong&gt; to chain new habits to existing ones. i.e., After I close my laptop for the day, I&amp;rsquo;ll immediately do 20 minutes of language homework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete list of habit strategies, checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf&#34;&gt;Atomic Habits cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;habits-work-best-applied-to-your-strengths&#34;&gt;Habits work best applied to your strengths:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your strengths are a cross between your genetics &amp;amp; your interests. What doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like work to you? What are you naturally predisposed to being great at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I think I&amp;rsquo;m great at communicating a goal to a team, organizing the team&amp;rsquo;s energy and focus to tackle the problem quickly. Allowing for new thoughts to form, connecting dots, and listening to others while creating a space that allows others to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a behaviour strength, which I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly come to learn about the more teamwork I&amp;rsquo;ve done. A personality test could have helped me uncover it too, but in general, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to be doing some &amp;ldquo;exploring&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when you&amp;rsquo;ve found a regime that fits you well, you can &amp;ldquo;exploit&amp;rdquo; it, for accelerated gains compared to your peers. This process is known as &amp;ldquo;explore vs. exploit&amp;rdquo;. You should always have a bit of both in your life; likely more explore while your young, and exploit once you&amp;rsquo;ve found your groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/5.&lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A collection of Naval Ravikant&amp;rsquo;s tweetstorms, discussions, and ideas woven into a digestible &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.navalmanack.com/&#34;&gt;ebook&lt;/a&gt;. The ideas focus on wealth on happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favourite ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tweetstorm-about-wealth-creation&#34;&gt;Tweetstorm about wealth creation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore ppl playing status games. They gain status by attacking ppl playing wealth creation games&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term ppl&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most ppl haven&amp;rsquo;t figured this out yet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play iterated games. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, from compound interest&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick your business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for, found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you, but look like work to others&amp;hellip; and is taught through apprenticeships, not school&amp;hellip; often highly technical or creative, it cannot be outsourced or automated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code &amp;amp; media). Code and media are permissionless leverage. They&amp;rsquo;re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid business magazines and business classes. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, math and computers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be too busy to &amp;ldquo;do coffee&amp;rdquo; while still keeping an uncluttered calendar&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re finally wealthy, you&amp;rsquo;ll realize it wasn&amp;rsquo;t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-a-position-of-leverage&#34;&gt;Find a position of leverage:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the CEO job is really a financial job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Capital scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the most democratic form [of leverage]&amp;hellip; is products with no marginal cost of replication. This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-get-lucky&#34;&gt;How to get lucky:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope luck finds you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hustle until you stumble into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extreme example of this last form of luck, as described in the book, is the following: &amp;ldquo;suppose you&amp;rsquo;re the best person in the world at deep-sea diving. You&amp;rsquo;re known to take dives no one else will dare attempt. By sheer luck, someone finds a sunken treasure they cannot get. Their luck has just become your luck, as they&amp;rsquo;re going to come to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-models&#34;&gt;Mental models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simple heuristic: if you&amp;rsquo;re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn to love to read&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Happiness is being satisfied with what you have&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an incredibly long list of book recommendations that I&amp;rsquo;m working through slowly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I agree with the book&amp;rsquo;s subtitle, this is definitely a mammoth overview of racist ideas in America. Starting with the racists ideas of colonial Europe that seeded the founding father, or white-religous-upperclassmen, as is more appropriate, up to Barack Obama, and some of the racist ideas he pondered aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to educate yourself on how poorly Black Americans have been treated by their peers and the policies in their society, look no further. It is a little long, but comes together quite nicely in the end. And it&amp;rsquo;s on Spotify as an audio book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-key-takeaway&#34;&gt;My key takeaway&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, to talk of a person as being different from the rest of society because of something about their race/sex/gender/age/etc., rather than their environment, is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the premise, and it is interesting to catch yourself being X-ist whenever you think thoughts upon a group. &lt;strong&gt;No individual should be stamped from the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;. And, as discussed by Malcom Gladwell in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cartar.github.io./books/talking2strangers/#my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;Talking to Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, you SHOULD consider an individual&amp;rsquo;s environment. Think about how their environment has shaped them before concluding what is a reasonable thought, or conducting your behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-discussion&#34;&gt;A discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to start at the end. Ibram X. Kendi concludes with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There will come a time when principled anti-racists are in power, and then anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racists ideas become the common sense of the people, and the anti-racists common sense of the people hold their anti-racists leaders and policies accountable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree. And like to think many people in power have thought themselves anti-racists, but, to this book&amp;rsquo;s credit, not been. Ibram shows exactly why not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Self-interest leads to racist policies, leads to racist ideas, which leads to ignorance and hate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that people elected into positions of power, literally charged to be other-interested, fail so miserably? Ibram claims it is because power is inherently self-interested. Power cannot make decisions that are against its self-interest. Otherwise, the power is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true. However, his solutions: i) to educate those without power to band together and grow in strength, and ii) that non-white-religous-upperclassmen who are self-interested should fight for anti-racisms because it is the precursor to humanity for all, are remist. Both of these solutions are principled to the same ideas that lead the founding fathers. Namely, together, we are strong enough to take power from the powerful and only then will there be peace for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I agree that &amp;ldquo;when we fight for humanity, we are fighting for ourselves.&amp;rdquo; And that we need principled anti-racists in power. And that we need to educate those without power the most of all. But the largest problem I see is not that education doesn&amp;rsquo;t work; it&amp;rsquo;s that our political system has totally fucked up incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us posit the job of our politicians to be caring for the entire population under their control, and the earth as a whole. That&amp;rsquo;s a tall order for any single person, so our politicians will need to work together to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there are many people involved, and to make progress will require alignment. Alignment of ideas requires, from time to time, the odd mind to be changed. This IS education. However, the problem arises whenever a needed solution is radically different from the accepted culture of the time. It is these moments that the powerful must decide between 2 choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through a solution that degrades their influence with a majority of people, thus leading to their removal from power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compromise a solution that neither fixes the problem, nor lose too much favor with the public such that they keep power (for now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the balancing act we ask of politicians, who rose to power off the piggy banks of individuals whose influence is yet another factor for the person in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need most of all is a new incentive system for our politicians. We need to remove donations from politicians&#39; bank roles. We need to incentivize quality decisions that positively affect those who are losing the most, as measured by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need reform of those who do the reforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe education does work, we just need the right incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This book is an epic undertaking, showcasing world history up to the early 2010&amp;rsquo;s, through the lense of the silk road. History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their ideas in a cohesive framework. The thesis presented here outlines how resource transportation routes shaped our world history. Equally important to the goods flowing through commerce were new ideas, including religions, and a massive game of political chess. Short term policies crafted to maintain power at the expense of those without it, often led to self destruction through overreach (and over spending). Worse still was the long term instability created by dying powers&#39; abrupt departure from battleground regions. The most shocking lesson I took away is how cyclical our world history is. The fight for power, and abhorrent disregard for others by those trying to maintain it, is the saddest trait we share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts off slow, but is worth persevering through. It started about 2000 years ago, with the empire of Persia, and the creation of the silk roads. From there, the rise and fall of new and old players, in a dance of power politics and war is spectacular. I hope one day we&amp;rsquo;ll learn from our history, and end the senseless killing of those who are simply trying their best to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-key-takeaways&#34;&gt;My key takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a world with hundreds of religions is reduced to a few&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the middle east is so unstable, well into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The luck involved to create a golden era
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly that era falls when the KingPin dies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All empires at the top of the totem pole eventually fall
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cause of their downfall is often overspending on military:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman empire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portugal/Spain in the 15th &amp;amp; 16th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;England in the 17th-20th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human cost required to sustain an empire is terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;how frequently history repeats itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regression-to-the-mean&#34;&gt;Regression to the mean&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression to the mean is the concept that, over time, event likelihood converges on the average result. Said another way, whenever an outlier occurs, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that the next event will be closer to the main outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has interesting implications within the workplace. Manager&amp;rsquo;s are stung when praising outstanding work that is followed by normal work; whereas chastising bad work is usually followed by better performance. However, neither the praise nor the reprimand likely had as large of an effect as regression to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normal-distribution&#34;&gt;Normal Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal distribution is the result of randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you see a normal distribution not caused by randomness, be suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you carefully measure something, if you do not see a normal distribution where randomness should occur (i.e., measurement error), you have likely destroyed the randomness that should be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defaulting to the truth is OK. It is what created our society and it would be stupid to override this companionship generating trait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coupling of environment and action is so strong that it should always be taken into account when interacting with strangers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t judge a stranger, judge their environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are bad lie detectors. We expect a liar to act one way, and a truth teller another. Our snap decision lie detection is never to be trusted.&lt;/li&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book, but am hesitant to recommend it to others. The writing is only OK, and so much of the content felt somewhat common sense. However, I did find multiple nuggets worth keeping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prototyping&#34;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When developing a business, iteration and feedback are key. Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one wants to pre-order a free prototype your offer is not valuable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reorganization&#34;&gt;Reorganization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random actions change things. Attempt to reorganize ideas is our body&amp;rsquo;s way of searching for solutions. When reference levels are violated, and we do not know what action to take next, try reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulations in your brain only works well with a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment&#34;&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to change things is by changing your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-levels&#34;&gt;Reference Levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do not have easily manipulated behavior. We are too complex for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather we have reference levels that, when out of whack, force us to make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinterpretation&#34;&gt;Reinterpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want to change your beliefs (or mental stimuli) simply follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall that belief in as much detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of alternative interpretations for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realize your belief is an interpretation, not fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discard your belief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose an alternative interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either moving towards or away from things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evolved to prioritize moving away, which makes sense from our ancestors point-of-view, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve us as well today. Understand this emotional tug-of-war when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we prioritize moving away, we focus on what is being lost. This can make us fearful of change, because we aren&amp;rsquo;t understanding the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection-test&#34;&gt;Selection Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental constraints that determine which systems can be self perpetuating and which ones die.
Know the selection tests for a market and you can change the field; especially as markets change due to tech.&lt;/p&gt;
