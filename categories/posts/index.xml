      <title>Our fast info-feed diet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows fast food isn’t good for you. But that doesn’t stop us from indulging once in a while, or feeling sorry for folks with unhealthy food addictions. That a burger can cost more than a broccoli head is a problem. But that isn’t the problem I want to talk about here. The infinite information feed, endlessly scrollable, sometimes sweet, definitely salty, condensed news. Delivered daily, 24/7, piping hot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The value of Cryptocurrencies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recall back in 2015 learning about Bitcoin, and thinking the idea was pretty cool. Problem was, I had very little time, and no money to invest, so the idea of buying Bitcoin remained on the todo list for an older me. In 2017, I revisited the idea, this time with a bit of money, but as I started to look into how to actually make a purchase, the market suddenly caught fire, and I felt I’d missed whatever opportunity had been present. Once again, buying crypto was put in the backseat for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Being Spiritual</title>
      <link>https://cartar.github.io./posts/being_spiritual/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spirituality has a bit of a bad rap in my opinion. For starters, it’s often associated with astrology, magical connections, and various forms of fortune telling. As if your life’s path can be understood in a grand cosmic sense, if only you’d let Professor Trelawney read your tea leaves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investing in cities during a Digital Boom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people call the 21st century the 4th social revolution: “digitalization”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen disruption to politics, banking/investing, education, healthcare, and many more sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we’ve also seen an uptick in abuse of these technologies and the harm they post to our monkey brains. The smart phone is not the same disruptive technology as the cell phone was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating Creativity and Environment Engineering</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;creativity-is-something-youre-born-with&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creativity is something you&amp;rsquo;re born with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call bull shit. People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions. But creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I believe your environment is more likely to contribute more to your creative output than your genetic makeup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Americans: should they be so proud?</title>
      <link>https://cartar.github.io./posts/america/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was recently pointed out to me, by a dual citizen family member, that America has a lot to be proud of. For example, they have by far the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country&#34;&gt;most number of nobel laureates&lt;/a&gt;, founded many of the most profitable companies in the world, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet&#34;&gt;created the internet&lt;/a&gt;, and has had &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution_and_worldwide_influence&#34;&gt;worldwide influenced on how democracy should operate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you aren’t happy with how a housemate leaves the kitchen, or maybe they take up too much shared living space, and you’d like them to pay a little more if they want to keep owning the space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe your significant other hides financial information from you, and you&amp;rsquo;re feeling the onset of financial abuse?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The value of emotion in policy</title>
      <link>https://cartar.github.io./posts/emotion_in_policy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What value does emotion add to our conversations about other people? Emotion makes conversation, well&amp;hellip; human. But, where does emotion get us when we&amp;rsquo;re making decisions &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; others? And not just one or two other people, but a collective. What is the value of emotion, when we&amp;rsquo;re making decisions for an organization, a city, a country, or the world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
