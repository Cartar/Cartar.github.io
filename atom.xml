                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This book is an epic undertaking, showcasing world history up to the early 2010&amp;rsquo;s, through the lense of the silk road. History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their idea&amp;rsquo;s in a cohesive framework. The thesis presented here outlines how resource transportation routes shaped our world history. Equally important to the goods flowing through commerce were new ideas, including religions, and a massive game of political chess. Short term policies crafted to maintain power at the expense of those without it, often led to self destruction through over reach (and over spending). Worse still was the long term instability created by dying powers abrupt departure from battleground regions. The most shocking lessons I took away is how cyclical our world history is. The fight for power, and abhorant disregard for others by those trying to maintain it, is the saddest trait we share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts off slow, but is worth perservering through. It starts about 2000 years ago, with the empire of Persia, and the creation of the silk roads. From there, the rise and fall of new and old players, in a dance of power politics and war is spectacular. I hope one day we&amp;rsquo;ll learn from our history, and end the senseless killing of those who are simply trying their best to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-key-takeaways&#34;&gt;My key takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a world with hundreds of religions is reduced to a few&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the middle east is so unstable, well into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The luck involved to create a golden era
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly that era falls when the KingPin dies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All empires at the top of the totem pole eventually fall
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cause of their downfall is often overspending on military:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman empire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portugal/Spain in the 15th &amp;amp; 16th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;England in the 17th-20th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human cost required to sustain an empire is terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;how frequently history repeats itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to have a strong background in math to get the full punch from this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regression-to-the-mean&#34;&gt;Regression to the mean&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression to the mean is the concept that, over time, event likihood converges on the average result. Said another way, whenever an outlier occurs, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that the next event will be closer to the main outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is interesting implications within the workplace. Manager&amp;rsquo;s are stung when praising outstanding work that is followed by normal work; whereas chastising bad work is usually followed by better performance. However, neither the praise nor the reprimand likely had as large of an effect as regression to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normal-distribution&#34;&gt;Normal Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal distribution is the result of randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you see a normal distribution not caused by randomness, be very suspicous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you carefully measure something, if you do not see a normal distribution where randomness should occur (i.e., measurement error), you have likely destroyed the randomness that should be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As usual, Malcolm Gladwell deliveries these stories in a wonderful read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defaulting to truth is OK. It is what created our society and it would be stupid to override this companionship generating trait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coupling of environment and action is so strong, that it should always be taken into account when interacting with strangers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t judge a stranger, judge their environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are bad lie detectors. We expect a liar to act one way, and a truth teller another. Our snap decision lie detection is never to be trusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prototyping&#34;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When developing a business, iteration and feedback are key. Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one wants to pre-order in free prototype your offer is in valuable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reorgnaization&#34;&gt;Reorgnaization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random actions change things. Attempt to reorganize ideas is our body&amp;rsquo;s way of searching for solutions. When reference levels are violated, and we do not know what action to take next, try reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulations in your brain only works really well with a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment&#34;&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to change things is by changing your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-levels&#34;&gt;Reference Levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do not have easily manipulated behavior. We are too complex for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather we have reference levels, that, when out of whack, force us to make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinterpretation&#34;&gt;Reinterpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want to change your beliefs (or mental stimuli) simply follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall that believe in as much detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of alternative interpretations for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realize your belief is an interpretation, not fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discard your belief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose an alternative interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either moving towards or away from things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evolves to prioritize moving away, which makes sense from our ancestors point-of-view, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve us as well today. Understand this emotional tug-of-war when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we prioritize moving away, we focus on what is being lost. This can make us fearful of change, because we aren&amp;rsquo;t understanding the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection-test&#34;&gt;Selection Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental constraints that determine which systems can be self perpetuating and which ones die.
Know the selection tests for a market and you can change the field; especially as markets change due to tech.&lt;/p&gt;
