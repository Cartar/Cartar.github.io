[{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"Some people call the 21st century the 4th social revolution: ‚Äúdigitalization‚Äù.\nWe‚Äôve seen disruption to politics, banking/investing, education, healthcare, and many more sectors of the economy.\nBut we‚Äôve also seen an uptick in abuse of these technologies and the harm they post to our monkey brains. The smart phone is not the same disruptive technology as the cell phone was.\nSo what does this mean for our world? There will continue to be tech winners and losers, but in general, the value added to markets will increase. As everyone becomes connected, we should slowly see less inequality, as the world becomes more accepting of others.\nOn the downside, it is possible for identity politics and online echo chambers to stifle productive conversation, and create more inequality instead of less.\nNew marketplaces will open up to replace stale bits of the economy. Take lending money for instance; new technology could disrupt how easy it is for loans to be made, killing high interest alternatives, and extending the reach of commerce beyond country borders.\nWe‚Äôve seen a surge in the marketplace for human resources, aka, the gig economy. Jobs continue to come, and go.\nHowever, for all the changes our digital era will bring, cities will remain cultural hubs of food, events, and general human flourishing. We are social beings, and we cannot thrive completely alone. Cities will continue to grow, as fewer hands are needed to work the fields.\nThe bright future of cities is partly responsible for the high market value of city housing. The safest investments are therefore in large cities, but with safety comes low expected returns.\nA riskier, and potentially more profitable investment would be to bet on cities with the most potential for growth.\nOr you could always invest in the tech revolution, but might that be irrational?\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Investing in cities during a Digital Boom","uri":"/posts/the_digital_world/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":" Creativity is something you‚Äôre born with.\n I call bull shit. People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions. But creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I believe your environment is likely to contribute more to your creative output than your genetic makeup.\nBut who cares what I think, let‚Äôs find out what science has to say. Specifically, let‚Äôs review a review: Research on Workplace Creativity (2000-2014).\nIn addition to learning the state of workplace creativity research (as of 2014; oh, and in plain language I should add), I‚Äôll introduce the idea of environment engineering, why it matters, and what you can do to improve your personal output, or team‚Äôs creative output.\nTL;DR: Everyone can be creative. Invest in leadership, team culture, and the individual‚Äôs environment.\nCreativity at the Workplace Let us first pause, and consider if creativity at the workplace is a good proxy for creativity as a whole? Go ahead, think for yourself - is it?\n  I believe it is a valuable proxy whenever creativity is needed within a team, and that team has some financial incentive in their delivery. However, creativity as a solo show, or within a team without financial ends, could have different considerations, or simply not map onto these points. However, many of the points here are general, and seem like they should deliver value outside of the workplace too.\nAll this to say, this research isn‚Äôt an absolute truth for all circumstances.\nThe Obvious A lot of the research had, in my opinion, obvious findings. But let‚Äôs not skip these points. It‚Äôs all too easy to get caught up in the nuanced or corner case findings, forgetting that the basics can get us where we needed to be. Let‚Äôs see some of these points listed out:\n ‚ÄúLeadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity‚Äù (duh).  Trustworthy leaders build team creativity.   All tasks should be given goals (but not too focused - use design thinking). Have positive belief in one‚Äôs capacity to perform their job. Autonomy is key (do not micromanage - again, duh). Moderate time pressure is good. ‚ÄúAllowing team members to tackle an idea-generation task individually first, before engaging in collective ideation led teams to generate ideas of higher quality‚Äù  So this is a nice list of things to do, but what about things not to do? Unfortunately, the review didn‚Äôt touch much on that research because, well, how to suppress creativity isn‚Äôt well studied. I guess there isn‚Äôt much money in it? Go figure ü§∑ However, there is one study mentioned. It showed knowledge hiding decreases an individual‚Äôs creativity.\n ‚ÄúThe main and moderated effect of knowledge hiding on the knowledge hider‚Äôs creativity was mediated by distrust of another person and in turn that person‚Äôs own knowledge hiding‚Äù.\n In other words, do unto others as you‚Äôd have them do onto you. You hid information from them, they‚Äôll hide it from you.\nTODO: (maybe)\n design thinking (task dependant):  Job control and an ability to apply routine results in self-reported creativity Moderate levels of time pressure resulting in the highest levels of creativity Viewing your daily work as challenging is linked to higher levels of daily creativity If multiple tasks, creativity is optimized when all tasks have goals and users have discretion to switch between tasks    The Nuanced Okay, so far, we‚Äôve basically reminded ourselves why culture matters; why it benefits a team to have strong leadership, not micro manage, and be kind to ourselves and others. Probably all things that have a positive affect outside of creativity too. What are some more nuanced findings brought to light by this review?\nFor starters, there are a few recommendations for leaders:\n Leaders sharing their inner struggles, and a broad amount of information leads to trust and positive information sharing, which leads to creativity. ‚ÄúLeader inspirational motivation on creative effort (an antecedent of creativity) was more positive when leaders were highly prototypical, and more negative when leaders were less prototypical‚Äù. Leaders thought of as creative role models can boost creativity by displaying unconventional behaviour. Creativity should be declared as a desirable outcome.  When expecting creativity, employees perform more creatively. This positive effect was seen when expectations came from coworkers or family and friends too. A classic example of meeting the expectation placed upon us by others.    Two of my favourite takeaways here showcase how true it is that we are social creatures. That creative expectations placed on us by others, and leaders displaying unconventional behaviour both improve our creativity shows how much our minds are fueled by those around us.\nBeyond useful tips for people leadership, there are some team values that can foster creativity:\n Team diversity boosted creativity only when team members excelled in taking on other‚Äôs perspectives.  Create a diverse team, AND a culture of listening to ideas that aren‚Äôt yours, and maybe oppose your beliefs.   Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively affected individuals‚Äô belief in their creativity. Transformational leadership helps to unlock creativity in general, and is necessary to unlock creativity benefits brought on by diversity. Reward those who benefit others; ‚Äúprosocial motivation‚Äù moderates intrinsic motivation for creativity.  Part of this motivation comes from a culture of help seeking. However, prosocial motivation comes at the expense of increased help giving, which negatively affects creativity.    Here we see a general theme arise. Having an environment where new ideas flow easily, free from echo chambers or dogmatic beliefs, elevates creativity for everyone involved. However, fall prey to close mindedness or stop listening to new ideas, and you‚Äôre sure to take a hit to your creativity.\nThe Context So far, these recommendations have been generally applicable. What about those ‚Äúactor‚Äìcontext‚Äù findings mentioned in the paper‚Äôs abstract? How might the same context affect people differently?\nFor example, the interplay of context and the individual leads to positive, or negative, or a mute impact on creativity. Let‚Äôs take a look:\n Benevolent leadership leads to creativity when autonomy is high, but NOT when job autonomy is low. For individuals with creative role identities (i.e., believing your results are delivered in part due to creative thinking), creativity was higher than peers only if organization support for creativity was perceived. If that support was perceived to be missing, their creative output was actually less than their peers. Individuals expecting an informational evaluation of their ideas performed better in their creativity when given a standard (or creative) example before working on a task. Conversely, individuals expecting a controlling evaluation of their ideas showed worse levels of creativity when given a standard example compared to no example at all! Moderate levels of competition fostered creativity within groups with stable membership (low levels of competition were bad, and high levels were no better than moderate). However, for groups that change frequently with new members, the effect of competition on creativity followed a U shape (good at low and high, but bad at moderate). To optimize creativity via social networks, you either want: i) high centrality and low outside ties, or ii) low centrality and high outside ties.  These examples highlight the need to consider each person, or their team, separately when trying to improve creativity. There is no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù solution here, as we‚Äôd expect.\nAdditional research will shed light on trade-offs for team‚Äôs trying to optimize heavily in one dimension. For example, trusting relationships with leaders has a positive effect for team creativity with a learning goal orientation, through information exchange. However, if instead of a learning goal orientation, your team has a performance approach orientation, this same mechanism (information exchange + trust in leadership) actually results in a negative impact to creativity. Interestingly, this double-edged sword works in reverse as well, where less-trusting relationships with leadership had a positive impact on team creativity with performance approach orientation.\n Gong and colleagues (2012b) showed that having a trusting relationship with the leader moderated the indirect effect of team learning goal orientation on team creativity through team information exchange such that this indirect effect was positive when teams had a trusting relationship with their leaders, but it was not significant when trust was low. Interestingly, and underscoring the need to look at the interplay of the creative actor and the surrounding context, having a trusting relationship with the leader had the opposite impact on the indirect effect of a team‚Äôs performance approach orientation on team creativity through information exchange. This effect was more positive when members reported a less-trusting relationship with their leader and more negative when the relationship with the leader was more trusting.\n Environment Engineering Clearly, the context which we find ourselves, or those we‚Äôre evaluating, is an integral part to success. This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. The more we‚Äôve learnt about human behaviour, the more we understand how crucial one‚Äôs environment is to shaping who we are. As I mention in my takeaways to Malcom Gladwell‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTalking to Strangers‚Äù, Don‚Äôt judge a stranger, judge their environment..\nEmpowered by this idea, we can purposely shape our environments for the better. Allowing our context to deliver value day after day. I call this Environment Engineering (not to be confused with Environmental Engineering, although I do see the problem I‚Äôve created for myself).\nIn the workplace, there are 3 primary environment changes we can make to improve creativity:\n Invest in your team‚Äôs culture. Incentivize information sharing, open mindedness, and seeking of diverse ideas for teams that have creative role identity. For example, have ‚Äúinformation sharing‚Äù, and ‚Äúinclusivity‚Äù as core competencies that employees (both leaders and makers) are evaluated against. Invest in leadership. Incentivize leaders to be vulnerable. Have them share genuine thoughts and feelings, both good and bad, which builds trust. Train leaders in the art of transformational leadership and how to craft clear goals with design thinking. Invest in the makers. Give them ownership, resources and equipment to succeed. Encourage them to believe in their abilities, and support them to learn missing skills. You‚Äôll see results aligned with expectations. Expect poor, non-creative output, and your makers will deliver; expect creative goodness, and you shall receive.  A couple of caveats: i) obviously leaders shouldn‚Äôt share sensitive company information that should be contained (i.e., poor performance of others, potential M\u0026A, etc.); ii) expecting greatness of an employee at all times is a high bar to reach, hence why I said goodness.\nAlso, I should clarify, a ‚Äúmaker‚Äù is an employee who makes (think associate), versus a ‚Äúleader‚Äù who leads (think manager).\nDo Not Overlook the 1% Improvement A king of environment engineering is Sir Dave Brailsford. He‚Äôs the man behind Britain‚Äôs dominance in cycling over the past decade.\nWhen he took over the cycling program, he got right to work improving the cyclist‚Äôs environment. James Clear outlined some of these improvements while on the Sam Harris Podcast. Sir Dave Brailsford started with the obvious improvements you‚Äôd expect: testing various bike suites to optimize aerodynamics, reducing the weight of the bikes beyond what had already been done, and implementing biotracking during fitness routines to optimize for the individuals the next day.\nHe then went above and beyond these more obvious environment changes. He painted the inside of their bike transportation truck white to help spot dirt on bikes. He hired surgeons to teach the team proper hand washing technique to reduce sickness. And he had all bikers A/B test over 30 pillows so everyone had the perfect pillow they could take with them to events.\nThese minor changes, thought of as 1% changes, have real dividends. Before Sir Dave Brailsford, Great Britain had never won the Tour De France. With him at the helm, they‚Äôve won 6 of the last 10 titles.\n\n  When Sir Brailsford speaks about marginal gains, he reinforces context changes similar to what was suggested by this research paper:\n Create a positive culture. Everyone knows their responsibilities, achieves them for the betterment of the team (knowledge sharing \u0026 open mindedness). Hire for behaviour fit more than technical prowess, and teach where needed. Have strong leaders who can create those clear responsibilities and positive environments (clear problem statements - design thinking). Give people ownership (autonomy), and a supportive environment to succeed.  Beyond the Workplace Environment engineering isn‚Äôt for the workplace alone. It‚Äôs a very powerful tool for self improvement too. As outlined by James Clear, habits are the compounding interest of self improvement.\n What are habits? they are the moment-by-moment decisions we make. How are decisions made? they are often the simplest choice to a current dilemma. What determines the simplest choice? the simplest choice is a function of your environment. Therefore, self improvement begins with improving your environment.  At a personal level, there is a ton of low hanging fruit anyone can do. For example, removing distractions from your environment can greatly improve focus by eliminating context switching. Try keeping your phone out of reach, with notifications off for everything except maybe phone calls or other possibly urgent forms of communication. Mute notifications for everything else. Or try working in an open space to fuel expansive thinking (a quiet park if your living arrangement cannot provide). If focus is what you need, maybe a closed-off dark room is preferable. Recognizing when you need to be alone, with your own thoughts, or together, sharing ideas, is another big environment change you can make.\nTry creating purposeful stress modulating reminders in your environment. Mindfulness meditation, and certain breathing exercises can quickly change your stress levels if they are unwantingly high. At times of unwanted stress, it can be hard to bring these tricks into the present moment. Maybe a poster, or a note, or a piece of artwork help ground you in times of unwanted stress. Make sure your environment has these reminders, and you have practice using them.\nIf you‚Äôre new to mindful as a tool for stress management, I suggest trying the Waking Up meditation app. If you‚Äôre unsure what breathing exercises to do, review Andrew Huberman‚Äôs work.   In closing Everyone can be creative. As said in the closing remarks of the paper,\n Our review suggests that leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity. Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity.\n Beyond leadership, invest in the context your team operates within. Create a culture of information sharing, and open mindedness. Total knowledge on a team is not simply a summation game. The distribution of this knowledge matters.\nInvest in the maker‚Äôs environment. Find those 1% gains that deliver success day after day. Clear responsibility and autonomy are prerequisites, of course, but don‚Äôt stop there. What additional resources / environment changes can you provide that will give your team the edge to outperform?\nAppendix: My favourite run on sentence from the paper‚Ä¶ gotta love peer reviewed literature:\n ‚ÄúThe limited number of factors studied at both levels [individual and team] of analysis renders premature a general conclusion as to whether creativity is an isomorphous construct across levels of analysis that displays homologous relations with a broad range of antecedents‚Äù\n ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Creating Creativity and Environment Engineering","uri":"/posts/creativity/"},{"categories":["Books"],"content":"I agree with the book‚Äôs subtitle, this is definitely a mammoth overview of racist ideas in America. Starting with the racists ideas of colonial Europe that seeded the founding father, or white-religous-upperclassmen, as is more appropriate, up to Barack Obama, and some of the racist ideas he pondered aloud.\nIf you want to educate yourself on how poorly Black Americans have been treated by their peers and the policies in their society, look no further. It is a little long, but comes together quite nicely in the end. And it‚Äôs on Spotify as an audio book!\nMy key takeaway Basically, to talk of a person as being different from the rest of society because of something about their race/sex/gender/age/etc., rather than their environment, is wrong.\nI agree with the premise, and it is interesting to catch yourself being X-ist whenever you think thoughts upon a group. No individual should be stamped from the beginning. And, as discussed by Malcom Gladwell in Talking to Strangers, you SHOULD consider an individual‚Äôs environment. Think about how their environment has shaped them before concluding what is a reasonable thought, or conducting your behaviour.\nA discussion I‚Äôd like to start at the end. Ibram X. Kendi concludes with the following:\n ‚ÄúThere will come a time when principled anti-racists are in power, and then anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racists ideas become the common sense of the people, and the anti-racists common sense of the people hold their anti-racists leaders and policies accountable.‚Äù\n I wholeheartedly agree. And like to think many people in power have thought themselves anti-racists, but, to this book‚Äôs credit, not been. Ibram shows exactly why not:\n ‚ÄúSelf-interest leads to racist policies, leads to racist ideas, which leads to ignorance and hate.‚Äù\n Why is it that people elected into positions of power, literally charged to be other-interested, fail so miserably? Ibram claims it is because power is inherently self-interested. Power cannot make decisions that are against its self-interest. Otherwise, the power is lost.\nThis is true. However, his solutions: i) to educate those without power to band together and grow in strength, and ii) that non-white-religous-upperclassmen who are self-interested should fight for anti-racisms because it is the precursor to humanity for all, are remist. Both of these solutions are principled to the same ideas that lead the founding fathers. Namely, together, we are strong enough to take power from the powerful and only then will there be peace for all.\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree that ‚Äúwhen we fight for humanity, we are fighting for ourselves.‚Äù And that we need principled anti-racists in power. And that we need to educate those without power the most of all. But the largest problem I see is not that education doesn‚Äôt work; it‚Äôs that our political system has totally fucked up incentives.\nLet us posit the job of our politicians to be caring for the entire population under their control, and the earth as a whole. That‚Äôs a tall order for any single person, so our politicians will need to work together to get the job done.\nClearly, there are many people involved, and to make progress will require alignment. Alignment of ideas requires, from time to time, the odd mind to be changed. This IS education. However, the problem arises whenever a needed solution is radically different from the accepted culture of the time. It is these moments that the powerful must decide between 2 choices:\n Push through a solution that degrades their influence with a majority of people, thus leading to their removal from power Compromise a solution that neither fixes the problem, nor lose too much favor with the public such that they keep power (for now)  This is the balancing act we ask of politicians, who rose to power off the piggy banks of individuals whose influence is yet another factor for the person in charge.\nWhat we need most of all is a new incentive system for our politicians. We need to remove donations from politicians‚Äô bank roles. We need to incentivize quality decisions that positively affect those who are losing the most, as measured by third parties.\nWe need reform of those who do the reforming.\nI believe education does work, we just need the right incentives.\n","description":"","subtitle":"The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America","tags":["Books"],"title":"Stamped From The Beginning","uri":"/books/stampedfromthebeginning/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"It was recently pointed out to me, by a dual citizen family member, that America has a lot to be proud of. For example, they have by far the most number of nobel laureates, founded many of the most profitable companies in the world, created the internet, and has had worldwide influenced on how democracy should operate.\nWe‚Äôd been discussing a Canadian classic, how we‚Äôre different from America. My stance was an air of elitism over America, because of their lacking liveable safety net and free health care. He agreed, but was quick to list the aforementioned achievements of the US, and questioned if their pedigree was fueled by their winner-takes-all society? In other words, could America have achieved as much world influence or innovation with more socially equal policies?\nYES Maybe they‚Äôd have achieved even greater success?\nWhy is it that American‚Äôs are so quick to be proud of their world dominance, without acknowledging how they got there? Surely they‚Äôd soften their bravado if colonial era wrongdoings were at the forefront of their history lessons. Not to mention the luck involved to finish World War 2 at the top (of the world).\nI argue that the amount of wealth generated by these two aspects of American history are far more consequential than their pro-wealth building policies.\nLet‚Äôs consider previous epicenters of world influence \u0026 innovation. Europe, before the US, was undergoing a scientific revolution. Worldwide commerce and colonialism had far reaching influence. Worse than the US, it privileged only a few monarchs, by taking from the masses. Free time for the elites sparked innovations in science and mathematics that did change the world. Like Newtonian mechanics, which gave European militaries the ability to precisely calculate projectile motion. Before Europe‚Äôs enlightenment, it was east Asian behemoth‚Äôs of the middle ages like the Byzantine empire and the Islamic world.\nIs it pro-wealth building policies, or accrued wealth that foster innovation and worldwide influence? It is understandable that many would answer ‚Äúboth‚Äù, but consider that throughout history, every nation state has had pro-wealth building policies. Yet, influence and innovation remained with the wealthy. Both Europe, and east Asia before them, had the money to hold power. Over time, that money is spent on the military to maintain power, until the money‚Äôs gone, and the power shifts.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is people. It‚Äôs not enough to simply have wealth, you also need a large marketplace to grow that wealth. The policies governing the massive marketplace do matter; monopolies are bad for the people, and capitalism has proven better than communism. But what I‚Äôm claiming is simply that wealth over wealth-generating policies leads to innovation and influence. Perhaps this is obvious, but if that is the case, why do American‚Äôs consistently claim to be the ‚Äúgreatest nation‚Äù because of their policies?\nThey should instead claim to be the greatest nation, because of the wealth they stole or lucked into This is a hugely different mindset. (A majority of?) American‚Äôs believe they created their success out of sheer will power. They did not. Their stolen wealth, off the back of colonial thievery, and mid-century luck put them on a path to dominance. They should be humble about the fortune they find themselves with. Instead, there is an air of deservedness that stifles humility, and reduces their social appetite to support the have nots.\nAmerican‚Äôs should be proud of their country, and work hard to recognize their errors, and their luck. They should stop idealizing the individual without also appreciating their privileged environment, and how their (white male) riches came to be.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Americans: should they be so proud?","uri":"/posts/america/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"Suppose you aren‚Äôt happy with how a housemate leaves the kitchen, or maybe they take up too much shared living space, and you‚Äôd like them to pay a little more if they want to keep owning the space.\nMaybe your significant other hides financial information from you, and you‚Äôre feeling the onset of financial abuse?\nWhatever the tough conversation is, have it now.

I‚Äôd probably be more content with life if I did. But I‚Äôd also be a totally different person than who I am.\nBeing money focused isn‚Äôt inherantly bad if your society values money.

That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, ‚ÄúWe are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.‚Äù The farmer said, ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, ‚ÄúOh, isn‚Äôt that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!‚Äù The farmer again said, ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, ‚ÄúOh dear, that‚Äôs too bad,‚Äù and the farmer responded, ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that great!‚Äù Again, he said, ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it‚Äôs really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad ‚Äî because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.   This story of a Chinese farmer, presented by Alan Watts in a collection of lectures titled ‚ÄúEastern Wisdom, Modern Life‚Äù, highlights the uncertainty of life wonderfully. Never knowing the consequence of (mis)fortune, is a lesson not often taught. Instead, young adults often learn only half this story through their own experience, to the detriment of their moral. That is, good fortune in one‚Äôs adolescence doesn‚Äôt necessarily lead to good fortune elsewhere. This is an obvious statement, and a massive generalization, but the idea here has massive consequences on our moral.\nTake for instance‚Ä¶\n great childhood -\u003e good first job, post-secondary school, love, or whatever is important to you overtime, the job stagnates, school sucks, the relationship becomes less fulfilling, or whatever maybe the slow down without a clear cause without a clear cause, the negative thoughts which resulted from a ‚Äúpositive situation‚Äù can grow; sometimes too large to be dealt with alone. But without a clear cause, it can seem easier to live in poorly designed moments that suppress the thoughts/feelings/situation, than work through the lemons on our head. But these lemons have power. This is the misfourtune that leads to fortune. Although it is impossible to know how long we have between the cycles, it is guaranteed that our brains bounce back. Mother nature is sneaky, she hardwired adaptive architure into the mainframe, so our software is never done updating. It is impossible to know how the hard times will change us, or which doors will open because of it. But it is certain that your situation will improve. In the meantime, talk about bad times, for they are real and need addressing. But keep your moral up too - for without it, you are harder to help, and slower to see the positive change happening around you.

Emoji","uri":"/snippets/markdownemojis/"},{"categories":["Books"],"content":"This book is an epic undertaking, showcasing world history up to the early 2010‚Äôs, through the lense of the silk road. History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their idea‚Äôs in a cohesive framework. The thesis presented here outlines how resource transportation routes shaped our world history. Equally important to the goods flowing through commerce were new ideas, including religions, and a massive game of political chess. Short term policies crafted to maintain power at the expense of those without it, often led to self destruction through over reach (and over spending). Worse still was the long term instability created by dying powers abrupt departure from battleground regions. The most shocking lessons I took away is how cyclical our world history is. The fight for power, and abhorant disregard for others by those trying to maintain it, is the saddest trait we share.\nThe book starts off slow, but is worth perservering through. It starts about 2000 years ago, with the empire of Persia, and the creation of the silk roads. From there, the rise and fall of new and old players, in a dance of power politics and war is spectacular. I hope one day we‚Äôll learn from our history, and end the senseless killing of those who are simply trying their best to get by.\nMy key takeaways  How a world with hundreds of religions is reduced to a few Why the middle east is so unstable, well into the 21st century The luck involved to create a golden era  How quickly that era falls when the KingPin dies   All empires at the top of the totem pole eventually fall  The cause of their downfall is often overspending on military:  Roman empire Portugal/Spain in the 15th \u0026 16th century England in the 17th-20th century     The human cost required to sustain an empire is terrible  And most importantly, how frequently history repeats itself.\n","description":"","subtitle":"A new History of the World","tags":["Books"],"title":"The Silk Roads","uri":"/books/silkroads/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hi there! Welcome to a few of my favourite things ‚ò∫Ô∏è It‚Äôs just a collection of thoughts and ideas that I wanted to keep.\nWho am I? The short answer is a Canadian who loves too many things for his own good. Friends \u0026 family, science, philosophy, sports, engineering, video games, coding, self improvement, meditation, cooking, travelling, investing‚Ä¶ the pursuit of happiness? You get the idea.\nThe downside to too many interests is that I‚Äôm not the best at anything, BUT, that was never the goal.\nThings I‚Äôm proud of  Canada - summarized well by Tobi L√ºtke‚Äôs article The case for swagger: Canadians have a lot to be proud of. Two years of my life spent learning about the Theory and Modelling of Light-Matter Interactions in Photonic Crystal Cavity Systems Coupled to Quantum Dot Ensembles - aka my Thesis title. Juniper Creates, a successful Canadian ecommerce service for influencers. I was one of 4 cofounders, but left the company in 2017 to pursuit a career in data science. Juniper‚Äôs success since then has been due to the cofounders who stayed (and the team they built!), but I‚Äôm still very proud for the parts I played. You‚Äôll still find me at Juniper events or team meetings üòÉ This blog! I think?  The long answer‚Ä¶ Fair warning, the remainder of this page is a long answer to the question: who are you?\nAs you‚Äôll find shortly, I am a bit of an open book. However, without a clear audience in mind, the following is quite a ramble. This is probably for future me to see how past me thought about young me. More likely, you‚Äôre not future me, but maybe you‚Äôll enjoy learning a bit more about my life! Or not. That is fine too. I wrote a lot.\nGrowing up üòá I grew up in Toronto (well, North York if you know the difference), in a quietish neighbourhood. I had what I imagine is a normal upper-middle class upbringing. Lots of sports, summer camps, hanging out with friends and playing video games. Both my parents were engineers, working at Ontario Power Generation where they met. They‚Äôre retired now, enjoying a very social 60‚Äôs.\nI was good at school, but not uniformly. This was especially apparent prior to high school. I remember in grade 7, thinking my parents only used math and science at work, and so considered other subjects less useful. ‚ÄúWhy learn poetry?‚Äù I asked my English teacher. ‚ÄúSo you can tell girls how much you love them‚Äù. This answer did not fly with me. Who cared about girls?! Well, I did, but no way would I let them know it.\nIf English class was hard, French was impossible. I dropped it as soon as I could, which in hindsight, was a bad move. Now 27, I need to learn French in preparation for a sabbatical with my bilingual girlfriend.\nMath had its challenges, but when I tried, I could usually figure it out. I wasn‚Äôt the kid who ‚Äújust got it‚Äù, but I‚Äôm happy about that. I think it taught me empathy, which is a hard skill to refine if you don‚Äôt struggle in some way. I also learnt that learning is hard, but always possible. And that a good (patient) teacher makes a huge difference.\nFinally, I was remarkably lucky to have great experiences at all the grade schools I went to. All 3 were Toronto public schools, 1-6, 7-8, and 9-12 in good neighbourhoods (certainly a factor). Some teachers were more memorable than others, but the biggest impact on my time in grade school was that my friend group remained largely intact. From about grade 3 onwards, I hung out with the same group of boys, and still have most of them as best friends today.\nIn grade 12, our group was 8 boys large, and 5 of us all decided to go to Queen‚Äôs together. So began the next chapter.\nUniversity üòù Math and science drew me to engineering, but I had no idea what kind. I had previously done well in biology and physics, so I thought biomechanical engineering would be a good fit. Fortunately, first year engineering at Queen‚Äôs was a general education, so I had some time to figure it out.\nAs I researched the 4th year courses available to a biomech eng, none were spiking my interest. However, there was this cool degree: Engineering Physics, with an electrical option that had 4th year courses like biomedical physics. Also, Laser Physics! Who didn‚Äôt want to learn how lasers work? As a final selling point, one of my high school best friends was planning to study Engineering Physics as well. That we‚Äôd be living together the next 3 years made it all too easy to pick my major.\nBesides choosing Engineering Physics as my major, first year showed me the power of teamwork. To do well in engineering, teamwork was necessary. No one could succeed academically (or party) on their own. Queen‚Äôs eng was a work hard, play hard culture. Looking back, it‚Äôs funny how memorable the parties were, while the studying is certainly a blur.\nThen came my first 4 months summer, and my first office job. I hated it. The people were wonderful, but they had no work to give me. My average day as the ‚Äúsummer intern‚Äù was:\n Wake up at 7:15 Get to work by 9 Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - usually the answer was no Complete the work, if any, taking ~ 30-60 minutes Wait until lunch (I had a laptop with internet, but had to look like I was doing things) Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - again, no Wait until 5 so I could leave Get home around 6, eat dinner, relax for an hour or two before bed  I never knew how boring it could be to be paid to do nothing, while needing to be ‚Äúvisible‚Äù. Truly mind-numbing. There is only so much escape the internet can provide.\nSecond year saw my first long term (1.5 year) relationship end. It was entirely my fault. I had been having doubts about the relationship for a few months, but was totally unable to share them out of fear that‚Äôd be too hurtful. Instead of working through the issues, I let the emotions bottle up, until one day everything just kind of came out, very much by accident. As I left her house, knowing we‚Äôd ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù without actually having said those words, I felt freedom. Having been a prisoner of my mind for so long, I forgot how calming life is when you can share unhappy thoughts openly.\nI also discovered some wicked cool math in second year, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another day.\nThe summer between 2nd and 3rd year was the best summer of my life. I was a camp instructor at Science Quest, a Queen‚Äôs science camp for kids. And I loved it. The first 2 weeks began with us creating hands-on learning modules. Each one would teach part of the science curriculum for Ontario schools grades 3-8, and every grade had a different module that took 2.5 hours to present. We‚Äôd toured schools across Ontario, some as far as a 5 hour drive north of Kingston. Teachers loved it, the kids loved it, and luckily, I loved it too. Every grade was different, every school was unique, but I never had a bad class. Even the kids who were too cool for our content would perk up after the introductory ‚Äúwow-em‚Äù - a short demonstration of the subjects power in the real world. For example, the wow-em I put together for a structures module (grade 4 I believe) was to stand on an empty soda can with all of my weight. A volunteer would then lightly touch the side with a ruler, and instantly, my weight crushed the can to nothing. If you‚Äôve never done this, it‚Äôs actually a lot of fun. The key is to make sure your soda can has no blemishes and is perfectly smooth. Also, make sure your weight is evenly distributed, and you should be able to stand up no problem (I weighed about 180 pounds)! Whoever lightly touches the can is always surprised that something so strong can crumble so easily. Structural weak points are cool.\nJuly \u0026 August turn Science Quest into a summer camp, with new kids each week. The content was similar, just with a lot more touch points for each kid. One of the biggest challenges was helping kids with disabilities learn, and more importantly, play nicely with everyone else. For all the effort we put in to making their lives a little better, we received equal parts appreciation from their families. The challenges faced by families who take care of loved ones with disabilities are not for the faint of heart, but the love it generates can be truly special.\nI also had a family vacation where I went scuba diving for the first time (it was amazing), AND went skydiving with my summer group of Queen‚Äôs friends near Kingston (equally amazing). Both of those are stories for another day, but I will say to anyone who‚Äôs on the fence about either activity: do it. 10/10 you will never forget those moments and they are wild.\nThird year was an epic journey of mind blowing physics (Quantum mechanics is fun when you have a good teacher), and a new, healthy relationship. I‚Äôd learnt a lot from my first relationship, and was on a high from my summer fun. I also knew I needed to find a way to stay in Kingston for the next summer, and so I applied to various academic positions. One in particular was a physics research position that would turn my 4th year thesis project into an accelerated masters thesis. I‚Äôd have to stay at Queen‚Äôs 1 more year, but that actually seemed like a good idea since my girlfriend was 1 year behind me. And so I started my masters in the summer between 3rd and 4th year.\nPhysics Overload üòµ Unfortunately, my masters had nothing to do with medical physics. It was theoretical nanophotonics, the study of light matter interactions in nano-sized objects. I had chosen the subject too quickly. In part, I was fearful I‚Äôd not find another Kingston employment opportunity for the summer; but also, I was happy to be done with my job search (I‚Äôd applied to a few non-academic postings that didn‚Äôt pan out).\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, there was a lot of cool stuff I learnt. A LOT. But I never loved the subject the way you need to, to excel in academia. There were a few times I thought about switching out, moving to the electrical department to pursue something a little more hands on, but I couldn‚Äôt overcome the sunk cost mentality of the many months I‚Äôd already put into the program.\nI did get a peak into an academic career path, which is an incredible life if you love the material. But there is a lot of grant work, and the potential mismatch between ‚Äúrock solid researcher‚Äù and ‚Äúuniversity professor‚Äù. Not to mention, it‚Äôs a very long journey. Most of my peers finished a masters (~2 years) before starting their PHD, which then took ~5 years on average. At this point, you‚Äôre looking for 1-2 postdoctoral research roles, which have a lot of competition, and are generally much more expensive for the prof to fund, limit the availability, and create incentives for professors to keep a steady stream of PHD candidates coming through their door. IF you make it through all the necessary training, let‚Äôs say in ~10 years, you‚Äôre still not guaranteed a professor posting will open up in your field. Let alone the country/province/city/university you‚Äôre most interested in.\nHaving said all of this, understanding hard unsolved problems, and hopefully how to solve them, is a forever skill. Though you might not use your research if you switch career paths halfway through, the learned ability to learn is forever transferrable. I guess the more time you spend in school, the more you refine this skillset.\nAlso, playing with start-of-the-art anything is cool too. Oh, and numerical methods are the real heros of applied theoretical physics.\nOn a more personal side, I went through my second long-term (1.5 years) break up midway through 4th year. This time the ending was mutual, as she was going on exchange, and we knew our relationship had problems that needed addressing. Timing and geography were our downfall, but we kept in touch and maybe could have gotten back together. Instead, we both found new relationships that summer.\nMy 3rd long term (1 year) relationship was the first time I was introduced to right-wing politics. It was very impactful for me to strongly engage in political conversation with someone who‚Äôs mind I wanted to change. At the same time, there were some good points she raised, and I discovered how different a story is presented, depending on the political ideology of the news source. Nowadays, I‚Äôm a big fan of central/agnostic new outlets, or, will try to consume media from both sides. The undoing of this year long love story had a messy ending, content for another post. All you need to know is that my 2016 summer was coming to a close, but I could already tell, this was one of my worst years yet.\nI was supposed to have graduated in September, the bulk of my thesis was done, but my research results were incomplete. I just needed a few more simulations to run to cover corner cases in my numerical theory. I woke up everyday feeling so close to the finish line, yet my professor was adamant my paper be submitted before I defend my thesis, and that couldn‚Äôt happen without these results. As the weeks went by, I began to question if I‚Äôd ever graduate.\nBroken up with, and worried I‚Äôd never graduate with the degree I no longer cared about, the last four months of 2016 were a struggle. So I decided to do what anyone else would do, and began building a company with my roommate Nikita.\nA start up üòØ He was something of a serial entrepreneur at the time, already having founded 2 other companies. The new idea of his was to use Shopify to build his brother, Denis (a growing YouTube star), an ecommerce website. This first test store was a surprising success, bringing in a few hundred dollars a month! It was mostly surprising because Denis had a small-ish following of less than 100K subscribers. Hearing how an ecommerce store could bring in an extra few hundred dollars a month, Denis‚Äôs fellow YouTube friends wanted Nikita to make them a store too. And so Imprint Creations was born, with Nikita at the helm, and myself brought in as his cofounder.\nWe were a two man team, with very different day jobs. Nikita was busy running his second start up by day, while I was at the lab running my simulations. By night, we‚Äôd build out new stores, reply to customer emails, and contract designers to create new products. By January, we‚Äôd sold enough merchandise to convince ourselves that this was truly a company, and worth our full attention.\nNikita knew another start up in the YouTube space, Juniper, who‚Äôs cofounders (Joel and Ryan) were working out of The Next Big Thing - a Vancouver based incubator. The four of us met virtually, and within the hour, decided we had real collaboration potential. They invited us to share their free office space, while we worked out the details.\nGlossing over a few considerations I had at the time: i) earlier in the summer of 2016, I‚Äôd been hired as a ski technician at Whistler for the 2017 Winter season; ii) I‚Äôd been hired as a Data Scientist at Capital One through campus recruiting, to start post graduation; iii) I had to defend my masters thesis January 23rd. What to do‚Ä¶\nAlthough I‚Äôd dreamed of being a ski bum, working on this start up was the clear choice. Whistler was out, but Vancouver was in! Capital One thought I was graduating in May, so I had the offer start date set to September 2017. Tons of time to figure out if I‚Äôd actually want to go there, or remain a cofounder (it was not).\nAnd so the plan was set, I‚Äôd work remotely in Ontario till my thesis was successfully defended (23rd) and submitted (27th). Then join Nikita and the Juniper boys in Vancouver (30th). Landing in Vancouver began a new journey with renewed focus and excitement. The full story of Vancouver and Imprint Creations is for another time, but I will say 2017 was the best year of my life.\nThe biggest challenge came in the summer. Do I continue to build this company with Nikita, or leave and start a career as a data scientist? At the time, data science was leading the 21st century career hype train. I was also beginning to miss the math, modelling and application of data. A lifetime in accademia wasn‚Äôt my future, but using data sure would be. In comparison, the day-to-day work of the start up was mostly relationship management. Uncertain which choice was ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, I decided to go where the learning was most pronounced. Thankfully, Nikita was sympathetic to my dilemma, and made it easy for me to transition out of the company.\nMy departure left Nikita a one man show, but Juniper was struggling with a similar problem. Ryan was off to work at Amazon, and Juniper was out of cash. The money was flowing for Imprint, mainly because Denis had skyrocketed his YouTube channel over that first year. Clearly, the business worked if your influencer was a big fish. The trouble, of course, was out muscling tons of competition to win the big fish influencers. Joel thought if they could figure out that formula, we‚Äôd be in business. And so Joel and Nikita merged Juniper and Imprint to pursue the mission of A premium merchandising solution for the world‚Äôs largest influencers.\nIn 2018, I had little involvement with our company, but returned in 2019 with a part time role as ‚Äúhead of culture‚Äù. Now known as Juniper Creates, we continue to grow, and have been on the lucky side of COVID. That is, we‚Äôre a fully remote company, who‚Äôs entire business is selling products via ecommerce.\nI digress. Returning to August of 2017, I emailed Capital One requesting to push out my start date 1 month, so I could travel. I figured there was no point in lying, and told them I‚Äôd been working on a start up the whole summer, and wanted a mini vacation before picking up the corporate life. I wasn‚Äôt sure what my response would be, but was delighted when they said yes. I‚Äôve come to learn that this flexibility is one of the best parts of working for a large corporation. I don‚Äôt know why more people don‚Äôt take advantage of it?\nI spent the month travelling Argentine and Chile with my older sister, who was living in Bueno Aires at the time. Again, a story for another time, but the month was exactly what I needed before diving into a completely new world of corporate finance.\nBig corporation life with big data üòå Everything was slower, yet more precise. I have never witnessed a ‚Äúbusiness decision‚Äù that didn‚Äôt involve multiple people, some form of modelling, and an expected financial impact - with a sensitivity analysis, of course.\nMy role as a ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù has not been what most people would think of, when they hear that job title. I have not been prototyping new models, to be better predictors than the competition, nor have I been maintaining existing models to remain finely tuned with daily trends. In fact, I‚Äôve done almost zero model work beyond simple net present value calculations. This is not to say Capital One doesn‚Äôt have data scientists working on state-of-the-art models, we do. It‚Äôs more that my role should have been titled ‚Äúdata expert‚Äù.\nDepending on what team I‚Äôm supporting, I‚Äôve been a data analyst, business analyst, data engineer, or Python engineer (I prefer to say Python over software since I‚Äôm not developing apps, GUIs, or resilient always-on systems; instead I create data tools in Python). And who knows, maybe my next rotation will be within the modelling team? The point is, there is much more than modelling that large enterprise organizations need done.\nIn my experience, good work has been measured by how well I‚Äôm able to straddle the business and tech worlds. Understanding the business problem, really getting into the nitty gritty, and improving the process is some way. Spoiler alert, the answer always involves data.\nI‚Äôve also come to recognize there are many paths ‚Äúup‚Äù at a large company. So far, mine has relied on rock solid communication, and a greater capacity to teach than my average peer. Thinking back to my favorite jobs, science instructor at Science Quest and being a TA for Dr. James Fraser, it makes sense that I‚Äôve gravitated towards teaching. I think to be a strong teacher, you have to have struggled in some way to have learnt the material yourself. Otherwise, you‚Äôll find yourself at a lose why others are facing roadblocks in the first place.\nFinally, I will forever admire Capital One for the amazing culture they‚Äôve created. Learning is a priority, having open and honest conversations is a priority. Teaching managers to be great people leaders is a priority. All of these things make it easy to feel like you belong, and feel like you‚Äôre valued. The work isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúsexiest‚Äù, which is particularly true for credit cards (the only product in Canada), and even more pronounced for those of use who were trained as engineers. I definitely miss the workshop and lab resources, where I could create a physical product, from idea to working prototype.\nIn summary, so far? I feel so fortunate to have seen how data is used in 3 very different career paths: the applied science academic, the ecommerce entrepreneur, and the big bank enterprise.\nI see the largest factor influencing how data is viewed being the goals each sector has.\nAcademia has the greatest attention to detail, fueled by their goal to uncover the truth. Mathematical rigor, peer reviews, world-wide collaborations, and long time horizons move academia into the future with better certainty than for-profit enterprises.\nNext is big corporations, motivated to apply data anywhere that is profitable. And boy is it profitable to apply it everywhere. When you‚Äôre a huge company, saving 1 hour per week per person in automatable computer tedium, or $1 per customer with better risk scores or marketing analytics adds up quickly. However, time is money, and decisions need to be made. The solution to this is tests, which themselves require a lot of monitoring to make sure the right programs are selected in the long term. All in all, more data is being produced, consumed, and acted upon more quickly, but this is a result of their scale. Their motivation is profit, which makes for an impatient parent when compared to ‚Äúuncover the truth‚Äù. Hence, one should be wary of results whenever big companies are funding the studies.\nIn last place, we have the entrepreneur. Their world is so fast, so network based, that no one has time to mull over the data. This isn‚Äôt to say data isn‚Äôt important, it is. You need to know your key performance indicators inside and out. But most dashboards are primitive, data production poor, and calculations done back-of-the envelope. Most of your time is spent proving the idea is profitable, or delivering your MVP, and then scaling (i.e., hiring the right team).\nFor medium sized companies, since I‚Äôve not worked at one, I cannot say for certain; BUT, I assume they‚Äôd fit between the start-up and big corp in terms of data use.\nBye! Anywho, that is me in a nutshell! Or at least, the 2020 me who is currently writing this. Honestly, I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this whole thing, so if you did, WOW! Also, why? Hopefully you found it both interesting and somewhat enjoyable üëè\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hi there!\nThis is some test code:\n1  var = \"this\"   ","description":"","subtitle":"this is a test","tags":null,"title":"Hello World","uri":"/code/test/"},{"categories":["Posts"],"content":"What value does emotion add to our conversations about other people? Emotion makes conversation, well‚Ä¶ human. But, where does emotion get us when we‚Äôre making decisions for others? And not just one or two other people, but a collective. What is the value of emotion, when we‚Äôre making decisions for an organization, a city, a country, or the world?\nThere clearly isn‚Äôt a black or white answer to this question. But I think this exercise, asking ourselves what value our emotions bring to decisions about many others, is worth thinking about.\nListening to others When we‚Äôre having conversations, emotions can be as powerful as the words themselves. Tone can differentiate comedy from cruelty, or desire from despise. It can stay with us, change us, in a way an emotionless conversation cannot.\nClearly, emotion is a valuable asset to good conversation. It directs our attention in powerful ways.\nConversations about policy The conversations that lead to decisions affecting many people are never easy. It is often the case that the decision generating the most impact is the most expensive. There are always trade offs.\nThe best decisions are ones that understood the whole picture. Better still if those involved can be honest and transparent; accepting the compromises they made to push for progress in their sphere of influence.\nGreater impact decisions take longer to make, as more voices are heard. This is why large companies move slow \u0026 startups move fast. It is also why governments take so long to make change (on top of their human resources completely changing every 4-8 years - but that‚Äôs another topic).\nUsing our emotion Our policies are made by humans. Whenever humans are making decisions for other humans, the bias of those making the decision is omnipresent. A healthy decision process will acknowledge this, and try its best to reduce bias. But our cognitive bias is a nasty bugger. Even if we pay attention to possible gotcha‚Äôs in our minds-eye, our subconscious will apply our bias to our emotions.\nTo remove our bias from decisions, we need to turn off our emotions.\nCan they hear you? Without emotion, the round table of decision makers is one where everyone‚Äôs opinion can change. Without bias, everyone should also be a better listener.\nBut without emotion, how well are new ideas heard? Can the decision makers empathize properly if they‚Äôve turned off their emotional antennas? Likely not very well.\nClearly, there remains a need for emotion at the decision table.\nThe value of emotion in policy Listen to others with emotion. Hear what is being said, and understand as many legitimate viewpoints as possible.\nMake decisions without emotion. Know that when you‚Äôve made a choice, it was without (much) bias, and a clear head.\n","description":"","subtitle":"How much is good to have?","tags":null,"title":"The value of emotion in policy","uri":"/posts/emotion_in_policy/"},{"categories":["Books"],"content":"This book was truly a wonderful read! If you want to learn about math‚Äôs history, you will love this book üíï\nYou do not need to have a strong background in math to get the full punch from this story.\nMy favourite takeaways Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is the concept that, over time, event likihood converges on the average result. Said another way, whenever an outlier occurs, there‚Äôs a good chance that the next event will be closer to the main outcome.\nThis idea is interesting implications within the workplace. Manager‚Äôs are stung when praising outstanding work that is followed by normal work; whereas chastising bad work is usually followed by better performance. However, neither the praise nor the reprimand likely had as large of an effect as regression to the mean.\nNormal Distribution The normal distribution is the result of randomness.\n Whatever you see a normal distribution not caused by randomness, be very suspicous. When you carefully measure something, if you do not see a normal distribution where randomness should occur (i.e., measurement error), you have likely destroyed the randomness that should be present.

As usual, Malcolm Gladwell deliveries these stories in a wonderful read.\nMy favourite takeaways  Defaulting to truth is OK. It is what created our society and it would be stupid to override this companionship generating trait. The coupling of environment and action is so strong, that it should always be taken into account when interacting with strangers.  Don‚Äôt judge a stranger, judge their environment.   We are bad lie detectors. We expect a liar to act one way, and a truth teller another. Our snap decision lie detection is never to be trusted.

Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.\nIf no one wants to pre-order in free prototype your offer is in valuable enough.\nReorgnaization Random actions change things. Attempt to reorganize ideas is our body‚Äôs way of searching for solutions. When reference levels are violated, and we do not know what action to take next, try reorganization.\nSimulations in your brain only works really well with a goal.\nEnvironment Easiest way to change things is by changing your environment.\nReference Levels Humans do not have easily manipulated behavior. We are too complex for that.\nRather we have reference levels, that, when out of whack, force us to make change.\nReinterpretation What do you want to change your beliefs (or mental stimuli) simply follow:\n Recall that believe in as much detail. Think of alternative interpretations for that. Realize your belief is an interpretation, not fact. Discard your belief. Choose an alternative interpretation.  Motivation Either moving towards or away from things.\nWe evolves to prioritize moving away, which makes sense from our ancestors point-of-view, but doesn‚Äôt serve us as well today. Understand this emotional tug-of-war when making decisions.\nAs we prioritize moving away, we focus on what is being lost. This can make us fearful of change, because we aren‚Äôt understanding the complete picture.\nSelection Test Environmental constraints that determine which systems can be self perpetuating and which ones die.

And I think she is probably right.\nOur society is amazing for a select few, pretty sweet for a majority, and then terribly broken for billions of people. To roll the dice, and potentially wind up in the broken category, is not a worthwhile risk when the alternative is to live amongst an ancient community, who likely live in far greater equality (albeit, far worse conditions). So much of our happiness is derived by comparison to our neighbours, which leads me to believe the overall happiness of a random person‚Äôs life was probably higher in ancient times than today.\nLet‚Äôs assume I am right, and we are less happy today. What is the cause of this? I think there is a simple-ish explanation:\n In rich countries, basic needs are mostly met for free, resulting in hard to define daily goals Work/life balance and daily fulfillment is not prioritized  What is the best way to fix our present? (See message to Sam in fb) There are 2 sides to fixing a broken system:\n With small incremental improvements on the current system Start from scratch  Both of these ways of fixing our systems work, and arguably in similar speeds. However, they are very, very different in their approach, and their outcome. It is hard to argue which is better, starting from scratch obviously allows for greater flexibility, but that can result in lost functionality of the previous model that had been working well.\nAt the end of the day, I think both of these ways to fix our systems should be done in tandem. This is commonplace at large organizations, where engineering teams often work to maintain the existing model, while a separate team create a complete new solution to the problem, with breaking changes that cause incompatibility. There is a period of time that both solutions are active, but eventually, the old system dies, and the cycle of improvement continues.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar‚Äôs Blog","uri":"/wip/back_to_the_future/"},{"categories":null,"content":"TODO: add headers\nVery interesting podcast about how revolutions, changes in society that affect every part of society, are reliant on investement. And, how invest into ‚Äúthe next revolution‚Äù isn‚Äôt available until the past revolution no longer delivers strong capital gains.\nSome of the mentioned past revolutions were the industrial (coal/oil, massive engineering, steel, electricity, etc.), the telephone, and the internet. Interestingly, it is quite hard for the winners of past revolutions to create the next one, because of how many large fixed costs rely on the current revolution. For example, AT\u0026T was pitched the internet (a decentralized connection node network) before it was prototyped by the US military. They simply couldn‚Äôt understand how creating a decentralized network would be profitable, given their monopoloy of a closed network. Similarly, IBM, in their infancy, thought the entire world would only need 3 computers to complete the various ‚Äúcomputer needs‚Äù. IBM was stuck in the electrical revolution, without realizing the world-wide-web was around the corner.\nSo, what is the next revolution to the internet? Well, you can be sure it‚Äôll take up a lot of capital, and that it won‚Äôt receive funding until the internet and it‚Äôs subsequent technological advancements / capital gains are dried up.\nThat may seem ways away, but I believe it is already here. Most innovation joins multiple pieces of the complex global resources of ‚Äúthings‚Äù together. The internet could not happen without first the telephone, nor the telephone without first the industrial revolution, and so on. Think about all the funds currently directed to drastically changing transportation (space, underground travel, electric cars - basically, everything Musk), communication (also Musk with Neurolink; or the various attempts of quantum computers), energy (fusion \u0026 other renewables), fincance (block-chain), or medicine (?).\nRevolutions are made by connecting existing idea‚Äôs with a sales pitch that provides explosive levels of investment, AND return. Bets are currently being placed, and new bets will continue to be placed, until the next revolution is clear.\nPersonally, I think the next revolution is in AR/VR. Only time will tell!\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Will Cartar‚Äôs Blog","uri":"/wip/the_next_revolution/"}]
