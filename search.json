[{"categories":null,"content":"Death Death is life’s greatest invention. It keeps our moments numbered in our love finite.\nYou never know when you’ll be doing some thing for the last time. But everything that you do will be done for the last time. This can be a very powerful realization. Every bad moment or negative thought is fleeting. No matter how many times can you enter that state there will eventually be a last time. The goal, of course, is to have a few of the bad moments while maximizing the good. And while there are always trade-offs between pleasure now, or later, the goal is not to be the richest person in the cemetary.\n1 2 3  Life is something that happens in a flash. We just have a brief moment here, and then we're gone.

History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their idea’s in a cohesive framework. That the pipeline of resources, starting with the silk road, has been the major thread in our world history.\nThe book starts off slow, but is worth perservering through the begging chapter’s many names, dates, regions and wars. It starts about 2000 years ago, following the quest for resource dominance. In the first millenia, these resources are luxury goods like silk, spices, or tea, along with military equiptment, horses and slaves. Sharing of the luxury goods to a select inner circle keep them content as they oversee mass inequality.\nMy main take aways History lessons:\n How a world with hundreds of religions is reduced to a few Why the middle east is a hotbed for endless fighting The luck involved to create a golden era  How quickly that era falls when the KingPin dies   The human cost required to sustain an empire  And most importantly, how frequently history repeats itself.\n","description":"","subtitle":"A new History of the World","tags":["Books"],"title":"The Silk Roads","uri":"/books/silkroads/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hi there!

Emotion makes conversation, well… human. But, where does emotion get us when we’re making decisions for others? And not just one or two other people, but a collective. What is the value of emotion, when we’re making decisions for an organization, a city, a country, or the world?\nThere clearly isn’t a black or white answer to this question. But I think this exercise, asking ourselves what value our emotions bring to decisions about many others, is worth thinking about.\nListening to others When we’re having conversations, emotions can be as powerful as the words themselves. Tone can differentiate comedy from cruelty, or desire from despise. It can stay with us, change us, in a way an emotionless conversation cannot.\nClearly, emotion is a valuable asset to good conversation. It directs our attention in powerful ways.\nConversations about policy The conversations that lead to decisions affecting many people are never easy. It is often the case that the decision generating the most impact is the most expensive. There are always trade offs.\nThe best decisions are ones that understood the whole picture. Better still if those involved can be honest and transparent; accepting the compromises they made to push for progress in their sphere of influence.\nGreater impact decisions take longer to make, as more voices are heard. This is why large companies move slow \u0026 startups move fast. It is also why governments take so long to make change (on top of their human resources completely changing every 4-8 years - but that’s another topic).\nUsing our emotion Our policies are made by humans. Whenever humans are making decisions for other humans, the bias of those making the decision is omnipresent. A healthy decision process will acknowledge this, and try its best to reduce bias. But our cognitive bias is a nasty bugger. Even if we pay attention to possible gotcha’s in our minds-eye, our subconscious will apply our bias to our emotions.\nTo remove our bias from decisions, we need to turn off our emotions.\nCan they hear you? Without emotion, the round table of decision makers is one where everyone’s opinion can change. Without bias, everyone should also be a better listener.\nBut without emotion, how well are new ideas heard? Can the decision makers empathize properly if they’ve turned off their emotional antennas? Likely not very well.\nClearly, there remains a need for emotion at the decision table.\nThe value of emotion in policy Listen to others with emotion. Hear what is being said, and understand as many legitimate viewpoints as possible.\nMake decisions without emotion. Know that when you’ve made a choice, it was without (much) bias, and a clear head.\n","description":"","subtitle":"How much is good to have?","tags":null,"title":"The value of emotion in policy","uri":"/posts/emotion_in_policy/"},{"categories":["Books"],"content":"In addition to this book being a wonderful read, here are my main take aways.\nRegression to the mean Regression to the mean is the concept that, over time, event likihood converges on the average result. Said another way, whenever an outlier occurs, there’s a good chance that the next event will be closer to the main outcome.\nThis idea is interesting implications within the workplace. Manager’s are stung when praising outstanding work that is followed by normal work; whereas chastising bad work is usually followed by better performance. However, neither the praise nor the reprimand likely had as large of an effect as regression to the mean.\nNormal Distribution The normal distribution is the result of randomness.\n Whatever you see a normal distribution not caused by randomness, be very suspicous. When you carefully measure something, if you do not see a normal distribution where randomness should occur (i.e., measurement error), you have likely destroyed the randomness that should be present.

As usual, Malcolm Gladwell deliveries these stories in an engaging book, that was easily devoured.\nMy main take aways:  Defaulting to truth is OK. It is what created our society and it would be stupid to override this companionship generating trait. The coupling of environment and action is very strong so strong that it is an aspect of interacting with strangers that should be taken into account companionship generating trait.  Don’t judge a stranger, judge their environment.   We are bad lies actors. We expect a liar to act one way and truth tellers another. Snap behaviour from interaction is almost impossible for us to notice.

The writting is only OK, and so much of the content felt somewhat common sense. However, I did find multiple nuggets worth keeping! These are my brief notes from those nuggets.\nPrototyping When developing a business, iteration and feedback are key. Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.\nIf no one wants to pre-order in free prototype your offer is in valuable enough.\nReorgnaization Random actions change things. Attempt to reorganize ideas is our body’s way of searching for solutions. When reference levels are violated, and we do not know what action to take next, try reorganization.\nSimulations in your brain only works really well with a goal.\nEnvironment Easiest way to change things is by changing your environment.\nReference Levels Humans do not have easily manipulated behavior. We are too complex for that.\nRather we have reference levels, that, when out of whack, force us to make change.\nReinterpretation What do you want to change your beliefs (or mental stimuli) simply follow:\n Recall that believe in as much detail. Think of alternative interpretations for that. Realize your belief is an interpretation, not fact. Discard your belief. Choose an alternative interpretation.  Motivation Either moving towards or away from things.\nWe evolves to prioritize moving away, which makes sense from our ancestors point-of-view, but doesn’t serve us as well today. Understand this emotional tug-of-war when making decisions.\nAs we prioritize moving away, we focus on what is being lost. This can make us fearful of change, because we aren’t understanding the complete picture.\nSelection Test Environmental constraints that determine which systems can be self perpetuating and which ones die. Know the selection tests for a market and you can change the field; especially as markets change due to tech.\n","description":"","subtitle":"Master the art of business","tags":["Books"],"title":"The Personal MBA","uri":"/books/mypersonalmba/"}]
