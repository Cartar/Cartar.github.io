      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like successful aging, this book is a fascinating read that compiles the latest understandings about our bodies into a compendium of knowledge with many recommendations. Much of this book is summarizing studies about which molecules - proteins, hormones, types of cholesterol, and cellular processes are benefited by eating well, not too much (or too little), exercise, and sleep. However, unlike successful aging, the recommendations can be too specialized at times, and require too many resources (time and money) to execute properly. For example, the discussion about exercise requires a personal trainer, and many hours a week to carry out. Or, to hit the recommended protein levels, one needs to be having a good amount of meat twice per day, every day, on top of a protein shake, and high protein snack. This just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem wise for the average person, or doable for the average household income. Having said all of this, the overall book was interesting nonetheless, and stacking this book with successful aging was enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, this book wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much anything new, as it was a compelling reminder to eat whole foods, or at the very least, purchase food who&amp;rsquo;s full list of ingredients you&amp;rsquo;d have at home. There is a slow, but steady, understanding of these so-called Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs), and their negative health implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who knew very little Chinese history, this was a fascinating book. We follow various underground historians, or dissidents as the Chinese government would call them, set across the ages. Some, hundreds of years ago, but mainly, it is the story of people keeping the past 100 years of history alive, despite the best efforts of the Chinese government to forget. The mass starvation during the great famine of the late 50&amp;rsquo;s under Mao&amp;rsquo;s mismanagement, mass burials of the cultural revolution, and the many executions or lifelong detention of &amp;ldquo;dissidents&amp;rdquo; for simply speaking with an open mind. As the party has changed hands from Mao, to Deng Xiaoping, and now Xi Jinping, the country has seen massive change. Much of it for the better, but the need to control history has resulted in lost truths which are harrowingly kept alive by a select few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book had a lot of hype, both online and from my friend who recommended it. I&amp;rsquo;ll say, it took a bit to get into but then I was hooked. The non-spoiler description from Good Reads reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Piranesiâ€™s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Team of Rivals</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone with little knowledge of the American Civil War, or President Lincoln, this book was equally fascinating and well written. Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s name hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone down in history because of his superior military knowhow, or skilful &amp;ldquo;statesmanship&amp;rdquo;, but because of his superior &amp;ldquo;peculiar moral power and greatness of character&amp;rdquo;. It is truly a shame that politicians are not like Lincoln - who was so keenly aware of making the morally correct choice, at the opportune time, that he was able to craft a cabinet of rivals that balanced themselves on the whole. As is often touted today of top tier leadership, you want to foster trust, respect, and open disagreement that allows for the best ideas to flourish. Creating a leadership team of &amp;ldquo;yes-people&amp;rdquo; is never good in the long run. Lincoln was ahead of his time here, as that is exactly the atmosphere he was able to create and maintain through arguably the most trying times in all of America&amp;rsquo;s history. Comparing Lincoln (the first elected President of the Republican Party), to Donald Trump shows the alarming distance politicians have travelled into a world of short term exuberance. It is no wonder that democracy should suffer with America so divided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This collection of stories from Richard Feynman&amp;rsquo;s life is a fascinating time capsule into life in the mid 1900&amp;rsquo;s. From his work on the Manhattan Project, to his inquisitive mind and child-like love of life, he truly is a magnificent character whose voice and adventures shine bright in this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the narrative a little hard to follow at first, but by the end, I was hooked. This sci-fi adventure is inventive in the creation of the antagonist, and keeps you wanting to learn more about their story. Having not read any literature from China before, I found there to a weight behind the backstory that was new to me. The author spoke of cultural revolution in China in a way that was unexpected, and captivating. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to read the next 2 parts of the adventure!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of stories demonstrating that people aren&amp;rsquo;t crazy, but they do sometimes fail to make reasonable decisions with their money. Being rational with money can sometimes be the unreasonable thing to do after you&amp;rsquo;ve factored in human psychology. This book is a fantastic starting point for anyone wanting to improve their relationship with money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with how impactful luck is in our lives, this book is an eye opener. Malcolm sheds light on how societal outliers achieved (or failed to achieve) greatness, and the role of luck in their journey. He recounts the luck of entrepreneurs in America born in the 1850â€™s (?), Jewish lawyers born in the 1920â€™s, and software engineers born in the 1950â€™s. The role of language &amp;amp; culture in airplane crashes, and many more interesting stories thatâ€™ll make you appreciate just how random life really is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A captivating recount of how Disney transformed over the past 20+ years. Bob reviews many acquisitions, and some near-misses (Disney almost bought Twitter before Disney +). A good read for anyone curious how big companies grow larger. Lots of lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a hard thing to do, especially in the moment, but those instances in which you find yourself hoping that something will work without being able to convincingly explain to yourself how it will work - that&amp;rsquo;s when a little bell should go off, and you should walk yourself through some clarifying questions. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem I need to solve? Does this solution make sense? If I&amp;rsquo;m feeling some doubt, why? Am I doing this for sound reasons or am I motivated by something personal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;A company&amp;rsquo;s culture is shaped by a lot of things, but this is one of the most important - you have to convey your priorities clearly and repeatedly. In my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s what separates great managers from the rest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can do a lot for the morale of the people around you (and therefore the people around them) just by taking the guesswork out of their day-to-day life&amp;hellip; This is where we want to be. This is how we&amp;rsquo;re going to get there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;My job was to set our company on a new path, and the first step was to defuse this unnecessary struggle. The easiest and most productive way to do that was to recognize that what Roy needed, ultimately, was to feel respected. That was precious to him, and it cost me and the company so little.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is you making a decision about them - not them as a person but the way they have performed in their job - and they need and deserve to know that it&amp;rsquo;s coming from you. You can&amp;rsquo;t make small talk once you bring someone in for that conversation. I normally say something along the lines of: &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve asked you to come in here for a difficult reason.&amp;rsquo; And then I try to be as direct about the issue as possible, explaining clearly and concisely what wasn&amp;rsquo;t working and why I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was going to change. I emphasize that it was a tough decision to make, and that I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s much harder on them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you respect the person, then you owe them a clear explanation for the decision you&amp;rsquo;re making. There&amp;rsquo;s no way for the conversation not to be painful, but at least it can be honest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;the hardest but also the most necessary lesson to keep in mind, that wherever you are along the path, you&amp;rsquo;re the same person you&amp;rsquo;ve always been.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;If something doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to you, it won&amp;rsquo;t be right for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4/5&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A well researched review of the necessary skepticism established Psychology fads need. Chapters focusing on the implicit bias test, grit, the power of self-esteem, power posing, prime world (everything we do is the result of previous priming sensory input), fears over &amp;ldquo;superpredators&amp;rdquo;, and the ability for war veteran&amp;rsquo;s to overcome PTSD with mental training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A memoir of an extraordinary childhood; one where quotes like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d gotten pretty good at shooting the revolver by the time I was 4&amp;rdquo; is but the tip of the iceberg. Parents who disliked &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo;, and thought their misfortunes were adventures to be had. Hard times were simply hard lessons, but not worth fussing over. A true look behind the curtain at some of America&amp;rsquo;s forgotten people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A wild ride through the early-mid 20th century Euro-America prison systems. Our autobiographical story is piloted by a Frenchman, who&amp;rsquo;s candour is contagious, often to his benefit, but at crucial moments, to his demise. Super fun to read; it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastical life story to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A must read for those itching to learn why they have a love hate relationship with technology. All ideas are presented alongside their empirical findings, including where the scientific community has a consensus, and where it does not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of these ideas are present in other self help books, like: sleep more, eat well, work less, and make time for slowness (yoga, meditation, nature walks without audio) and play. But the studies and storytelling in this book make it worthwhile nonetheless for those who are already familiar with this list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How degrowth will save the world&amp;rdquo;. This book describes how we might move away from a constantly growing economy, to one that is decelerating, without harming the people who live in it, and in fact, improving their lives along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get us there, the &amp;ldquo;upper class 1%&amp;rdquo; will suffer; they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to consume at the current multiplier they enjoy. But they too will benefit from a healthier way of life, and a society that is more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A dot-com winner, then loser, then back to the top story. Lots of building-a-business advice from a very unique person. A lot of his focus is on the customer, and internal culture. Sorta changed my perception of what a &amp;ldquo;head of culture&amp;rdquo; can even do at a company. Namely, they can facilitate an environment to help people connect, but that could be very different for each person, and at the end of the day, culture is what is &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; by each person. The collective average being that which is its core, but truly, it&amp;rsquo;s just a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with the book&amp;rsquo;s subtitle, this is definitely a mammoth overview of racist ideas in America. Starting with the racists ideas of colonial Europe that seeded the founding father, or white-religous-upperclassmen, as is more appropriate, up to Barack Obama, and some of the racist ideas he pondered aloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book, but am hesitant to recommend it to others. The writing is only OK, and so much of the content felt somewhat common sense. However, I did find multiple nuggets worth keeping!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-favourite-takeaways&#34;&gt;My favourite takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;prototyping&#34;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When developing a business, iteration and feedback are key. Offering a pre-order with full access to the witten Prototype (description of what is being offered) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
